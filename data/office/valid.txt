Erin: [to dwight] yeah, but i'm confused...
Dwight: total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when you're talking about d.p.a., that's deaths per acre...
Erin: mm-hmm.
Dwight: ...nothing beats the battle of schrute farms.
Erin: oh. d.p.a. sounds way more important that total deaths.
Dwight: oh, it is. and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. i mean, it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] i'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. so beautifully written.
Oscar: dwight, what are you telling this girl?
Dwight: the truth.
Oscar: stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? she doesn't know any better.
Erin: oscar, i am so glad you just got here. i would've believed everything he said.
Dwight: no, no, no! you're filling her head with nonsense. you and the history books. i'm telling the truth.
Erin: interesting.
Dwight: yes, thank you. all of history has been whitewashed.
Oscar: really? why don't you tell us the real history, gore vidal?
Dwight: okay, i will. i don't know who that is, but i'm gonna tell you this-
Oscar: he's a historian.
Dwight: gettysburg was very important. credit where credit is due, okay? big, mad props to gettysburg. was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Oscar: yes, yes, yes!
Dwight: not by a long shot!
Erin: no!
Oscar: yes!
Dwight: no, it was not!
Oscar: argh!
Dwight: no, it was not. was it the second-most northern?
Oscar: what?
Dwight: sure! i will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Oscar: erin-
Dwight: was it the northernmost? no. get out of here, oscar.
Erin: get out of here!
Other: i am so eager to hear your game-changers. let's dig in, shall we?
Ryan: may i go first?
Other: absolutely.
Ryan: raw fish- the disgusting food from japan that americans would never want to eat. now, we can't get enough of it. from movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. let me throw another idea at you. origami. what? the crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, japan. don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in manhattan? we can do that! with... origami. it's the sushi of paper.
Other: this idea hasn't gripped me. what else did you come up with?
Ryan: well i had to memorize the presentation, robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Other: that was bad.
Other: if your woman is like mine, i bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. this paper is so hard. it scratches. why can't there be a paper just for me? well now there is. 'papyr.' paper for women. it's pink, scented and silky soft. now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
Other: the situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one i'm familiar with.
Other: in the african-american community-
Other: no.
Other: [murmurs] thought it was worth a try.
Darryl: that's fascinating. tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
Other: oh, well, that's a great question. actually some of the most-
Dwight: excuse me, i got a question for you.
Other: sure.
Dwight: can you tell us about the battle of schrute farms?
Other: uh, i haven't heard of that one.
Dwight: really. okay, follow-up question. how much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
Oscar: i apologize for my friend and for the republicans who are cutting your funding.
Andy: we don't need to bother this poor gentleman. i know exactly where we're going. giddy up! tallyho!
Other: [taps gabe's shoulder] are you lincoln?
Other: no, no, i'm-
Other: apparently, i bear a passing resemblance to abraham lincoln. makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... i don't see it.
chelsea's mom: chelsea, give mr. lincoln your hat so i can take a picture.
Other: okay, quick.
Other: hey! lincoln's starting. [light applause]
Other: oh, uh, no. no, no, no, no. i'm, uh, i'm actually with a tour group myself, so- [laughter] hello! i'm abraham lincoln! some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny. [laughter]
Pam: okay. you know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. i was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as i tell it, i don't like it. unless, of course, you are responding to it.
Other: i am not.
Pam: um, excuse me. i'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Pam: at this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. the other day i spit my gum out on the carpet.
Other: kevin, you've been quiet. i'm curious to know what your game-changer is.
Kevin: well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the a-1 spot? they do that 'cause they think a-1's the best spot for the best cookie. but the real best spot is d-4. right? that's where the eyes go. so...
Other: cookies. cookie placement.
Kevin: yeah. but not just the cookies, though. that was just a 'for instance.'
Other: who else agrees with kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, robert laughs] there you go. consensus.
Ryan: okay, we are now on a planet where kevin is the most creative person around, and i am just some good-looking guy.
Other: [as lincoln] i just don't understand. it's 1865, victory is ours, i've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Other: no!
Kevin: kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. who even wants them? i mean, i've seen toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Other: interesting. so what is dunder mifflin's oatmeal cookie? what is the product that no one wants?
Other: how about that two-hole-punch letter? only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
Other: that's the oatmeal cookie. fantastic, kevin. fantastic. [laughs]
Kevin: thank you.
Jim: by the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
Andy: let's talk about food for a second. food for thought.
Jim: yeah, that's what i had for breakfast and i think that's probably why i'm still hungry.
Andy: hunger! hunger for victory! hunger for honor. hunger for pride.
Darryl: hunger for hamburger.
Erin: hunger for chicken chimichangas. right, darryl?
Darryl: that's good.
Andy: exactly. now do you know the civil war soldiers were hungry for? pride! now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. colonel harrison jeffords of the fourth michigan infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. he wasn't about to let them have that flag. pride. right, guys? [holds up flag] i commissioned this flag for dunder mifflin. cost me two hundred dollars.
Jim: only two hundred dollars?
Andy: we are all branches on this tree. and from the tree comes paper. we're all part of a business. but business is war. what's that i hear? uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! wha- what's going on here? wee-hoo! come and get it! who's gonna get the flag? who's getting it? whoa! hey! ho! don't look where i am, look where i'm going. juke right, juke left.
Darryl: andy, this is inappropriate. people died here, man.
Andy: get the flag! get the flag! come on, big tuna. what you gonna do about it? we got a flag right here. wee-hoo!
Andy: spangler springs is a mile this way.
Jim: oh wow.  so that???s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Andy: its??? i mean come on.
Phyllis: i don???t think i should walk anymore.  you know all i had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  two poached eggs.  and then half a sandwich on the bus.
Andy: alright fine.  you know what ??? i guess this place just hasn???t rubbed off on you the way i hoped it would.  i???m still going.  and i???m not going to ask anymore.  i???m not even going to look back.  i???m just going to assume that you???re with me.
Dwight: [andy looks back to find everyone sitting] you said you weren???t going to look back.
Other: and why is black rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
Kevin: i don???t know.
Other: right.  i mean you???re an accountant.  those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
Kevin: yes.  i am an accountant.
Oscar: dwight ??? this is one of the archivists here.  i thought maybe we could consult him.
Dwight: really?
Oscar: yeah.
Dwight: well.  anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms.
Other: schrute farms did you say?  that is a fascinating little chapter of the civil war.
Oscar: you???ve heard about it?
Dwight: yes!  ha!  prepare to be refuted!  go on.
Other: there you go.
Other: families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front.
Other: dearest mother i???m sorry it has been so long since my last letter.  it is three months since i arrived at schrute farms and i fear i may never leave this place alive.  melvin fifer garris.
Dwight: hallowed ground.
Other: but the battle at schrute farms was no battle at all.  it was a code used by pacifists from both north and south who turned the pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.
Other: [on film] you have to understand.  poets, artists, dancers ??? these kind of men preferred peace to war.  these delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the schrutes at schrute farms.  amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight.  i like to think of schrute farms as the underground railroad for the sensitive??? and well??? fabulous.
Oscar: wow.  this is so much better than the story you made up.
Dwight: i???ve seen enough.
Oscar: you???re right.  there should be a monument to this.
Kevin: never trust a cookie with a woman???s name.  pecan sandy.  lorna doone.  madeline.  they???ll just break your heart.
Other: [laughing] kevin!
Ryan: robert i hate to interrupt.  but i would love to pitch you one last idea.  i call it the big mac idea.
Kevin: what?!? no!
Other: big mac idea.  that sounds encouraging.
Ryan: it???s really, really good robert.  let me explain.
Kevin: no!  this is not fair!  this is my idea.  he???s trying to steal it because he???s jealous of me.
Other: well what is the idea?
Kevin: every time you buy a big mac you set one ingredient aside.  then at the end of the week you have a free big mac.  and you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
Ryan: you know what?  now i remember.  that was your idea. [patting kevin on the back] that is 100 percent your idea.
Other: oh my.  it was just actually cookies the whole time?
Andy: [making pencil imprint] dammit.
Darryl: hey.
Andy: you guys came.  where???s everyone else?
Darryl: back at the bus.  we were locked out.  phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
Andy: yeah i asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  i guess he follows orders.
Jim: yeah sorry everyone else didn???t come.  i think they???re just tired.  with holes in their shoes.  and they have dysentery.
Andy: even without an audience you???re still at it.
Jim: what are you talking about?
Andy: our office has a disease.  and it goes by many names.  sarcasm.  snark.  wisecracks.  you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  that???s what you did with this trip.
Jim: andy ??? this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  it???s just not true.  we just work at a paper company.  and you???re our regional manager.  and guess what man?  you don???t have to prove anything.  we like you as regional manager.  andy if you don???t believe me take a look at what???s on my head.  i???m wearing a very pink hat.  i???ve been getting weird looks all day because i???m pretty sure ???dm does gb??? means something kinda sexual.  but guess who???s wearing them?  all of us.  just for you man.  that???s huge.
Andy: you don???t like the hats?
Jim: they???re terrible.
Darryl: i hate myself.
Andy: they just didn???t turn out how i wanted.  in my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
Andy: [voiceover the three walking] the world will little note, nor long remember the fight jim and i had here at gettysburg and that???s good because i was basically wrong.  i wanted my team to be, like, this army and i was their general.  but i guess it???s really more like they???re just people who work in an office and i???m their manager.  yeah that???s really probably a better analogy now that i think about it.
Other: abe and mary are seated watching the show. [in lincoln voice] oh mary this is wonderful??? ok mary stop your scolding.  i???ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] i need her like i need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] bang!  ooh [gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, gabe picks up the lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ???dm does gb??? hat and runs off]
Other: haha! there he is. you mind lending a hand? i'm typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.
Kevin: i can do that.
Other: great....ok.
Kevin: your arm feels good on my back.
Kevin: for some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. it's not my specialty. my specialty is pizza. but i'm flexible.
Andy: charge!
Kelly: isn't gettysburg like three hours away?
Erin: no. it's like two hours and forty-six minutes.
Andy: it's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. and tuna, i made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.
Jim: tuna?
Andy: yes! tuna of the land. turkey. with pesto.
Jim: and to drink?
Andy: water.
Jim: oh-ho, i am in.
Jim: i'm excited, i've actually never been to gettysburg. uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so i freaked out and we turned the car around. but i'm older now, i can outrun a zombie.
Andy: getting everyone on the bus, check. giving everyone hats, check. sexiest eastern european girls, uh, check.
Darryl: hey, devil's den is that way, we should check it out. that's where the snipers hid.
Andy: please! everyone and their mother goes to devil's den. it's the olive garden of gettysburg.
Phyllis: oh, i like olive garden.
Andy: well, i meant that in a bad way. obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.
Jim: where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
Andy: that is what i'm showing you.
Dwight: i know what you guys are all thinking right now: hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? joke's on you. it only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
Dwight: best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
Oscar: guys! over here, we found the bus.
Phyllis: open the door, jim.
Jim: it's locked.
Phyllis: are you sure? yeah, it's locked.
Dwight: it's not locked, gimme that...
Jim: that's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
Dwight: it's, it's latched closed.
Jim: ok, you know what? andy probably has the number for this guy. i'm gonna find him.
Darryl: i'll come with you.
Phyllis: ow! ee! i sat on my sandwich.
Oscar: and that's how the printing press was invented.
Andy: [enters office doing michael jackson impression] everybody beat it. don't beat it, stay where you are.
Erin: there you are. dillinger graphics said their shipment is late.
Andy: what did you say?
Erin: nothing, i just-
Andy: what would you say?
Erin: that it'll be the first shipment out today.
Andy: that is exactly the right thing to say! do it! git-er-done! phyllis, you just married joe order, you're new name is phyllis order [fill this order], get it?
Phyllis: i don't get it.
Andy: jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four pm today, it has been moved up to now. yes.
Jim: we didn't have one scheduled.
Dwight: [knocks water bottle on to jim's desk] oh, little help. wow your hair is really thinning.
Dwight: standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. picture someone doing something heroic. now was he sitting or standing? not counting fdr.
Dwight: every second you sit there is an hour off your life. look at all of you. i feel like you???re in a suicide cult.
Other: no. no. no. you???re way off on that one.
Dwight: oh yeah?
Oscar: are you really comfortable standing there? i tried one of those and i just never hit the sweet spot.
Jim: hey guys let???s just all admit it. ok? dwight???s better than us. he had the guts to stop sitting. and he???s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Dwight: that???s right jim.
Darryl: hey man.
Dwight: [jumping up from an almost sitting position] hey.
Darryl: taking a load off huh?
Dwight: no. putting a load on more like it.
Darryl: good luck with that.
Dwight: last thing i need is luck. [hunches down again]
Dwight: [to angela] thank you so much. [hums]
Jim: [sees a pole poking out dwight???s pant leg] what are you up to? oops look out! [grabs dwight's wallet]
Dwight: what are you doing? give that back. come on!
Jim: prank! [throws money from dwight???s wallet on the floor]
Dwight: oh that???s real creative.
Jim: you know what it???s not my best. because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Dwight: i could, but i just don???t feel like it loser.
Jim: because you???re sitting?
Dwight: standing.
Jim: ok.
Dwight: don???t!
Jim: because you???re sitting?
Dwight: standing.
Jim: you know i have to do this.
Dwight: i know. [jim pushes him over, dwight screams]
Andy: [signing his name] andrew??? baines??? bernard.
Jim: i think you could just do andy bernard.
Andy: andrew baines bernard. i love filling these out. because it???s like taking a test, but i know the answers.
Other: [loudly knocking on the window] in four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. i told her she could work here. under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to mrs. california] there you are! honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
Andy: what was that?
Jim: i don???t know. he wasn???t talking to me. but if i were you i wouldn???t hire his wife.
Ryan: that???s why my foundation ??? the dream for a wish foundation ??? is going to put them out of business. they???re not going to know what hit them.
Other: everyone. i???d like to introduce my wife mrs. robert california. mrs. california this is everyone.
Other: hello. oh call me susan please.
Other: last night at dinner susan and i were talking about her returning to work. so she???s here today to see if there???s a good fit. something tells me it just might work out. this is andy bernard the regional manager.
Other: hello nice to meet you.
Andy: hey there. it???s a pleasure.
Other: andy would you be so kind as to show susan around the office. show her the various departments. find a place where she???ll shine.
Andy: i would love to. but i have to be completely honest with you guys. we???re 100 percent staffed up.
Other: andy. let???s see if there???s a good fit first. then we???ll talk.
Andy: alright.
Dwight: knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Darryl: you don???t have to say it if you???re doing it.
Dwight: [laughs] remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Darryl: uh weight lifting yeah.
Dwight: well today???s your lucky day. i have opened in this very office building dwight schrute???s gym for muscles. you wanna take a look?
Darryl: i???ll take a look.
Dwight: your path from obesity begins right here!
Darryl: i???ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and val] for my health. i used to say i wanted to live long enough to see a black president. i didn???t realize how easy that would be. so now i want to live long enough to see a really, really gay president. or a supermodel president. i want to see all the different kinds of presidents.
Dwight: obese people in my office are a drain on resources. chairs wear out faster, it takes more freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive bms bust the rivets on my pipes. but a gym turns fat into cash.
Andy: alright! the dm express is pulling out.
Other: well it was really nice to meet you brian.
Ryan: actually ryan.
Other: oh, ryan.
Ryan: bitttch!
Andy: we will start here at erinville.
Other: hi.
Erin: hoo-hoo!
Andy: reception. your classic one-man operation.
Erin: although i was watching a movie and merryl streep had two secretaries.
Andy: i was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over san francisco. just saying.
Other: two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. certainly worth exploring; wouldn???t you agree andy?
Andy: i???ll explore exploring it.
Other: good. it seems like you have this under control. so i???ll just duck out and run the company for a while.
Andy: ok uh next stop on the tour sales. here we go. station stop jim halpert. oh boy our resident truth teller. [jim laughs nervously] alright have at it. let ???er rip. what do you hate about this place?
Jim: well it???s sales. so you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Dwight: maybe you do. hi. i???m dwight. sales is really not so hard ok? it???s paper. we have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Andy: jim?
Jim: well it???s not that easy. it???s kind of sometimes difficult.
Dwight: it???s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] being a mom.
Other: i love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Dwight: that is true.
Andy: you know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head mr. dwight schrute.
Dwight: that???s me.
Andy: dwight why don???t you tell susan about some of your hobbies. survival skills. ranking of animals.
Dwight: maybe over a beer after she???s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
Other: well make that a red wine and i???ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
Andy: oh how am i supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with susan]. the entire office is being nice to her than they???ve ever been to me. what i wouldn???t give for one of phyllis??? classic room clearing farts right now.
Dwight: ready? what do you think?
Darryl: um no. this is not a gym. this is like a scene out of saw 5.
Dwight: you haven???t even looked around yet. look. gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] right? dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. you ever cut tin before? five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. plus i will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. now let???s go over membership. i???m going to need the first month???s and the last month???s up front. $49 per month. but every third month is $59 a month. but the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month???
Darryl: obviously you know how a gym works. so you know i???m not going to pay money for this. you want people to come to your gym? make a real gym.
Dwight: darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
Darryl: make a real gym.
Other: i was thinking accounting might be a good fit because i really clicked with oscar and i do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Andy: but we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Other: uh i could work in customer service. hr even.
Andy: those are fully staffed as well.
Other: are you telling me that there???s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
Andy: [laughing nervously] yes.
Other: i am the ceo and i am telling an employee of mine what to do.
Andy: let me beat around the bush for a second. our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Other: robert this is very uncomfortable. obviously there???s no place for me here. so thank you for trying. why don???t we just let it go.
Other: no. absolutely not. andrew there must be something you can do. think.
Andy: there are lots of considerations.
Other: i would be eternally grateful. it???s not a bad thing to have the ceo owe you one.
Andy: alright. well then welcome aboard.
Other: so what happens next?
Andy: we get you over to hr and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] hang on. hello?
Other: [on phone] say hello grandma.
Andy: hi gam-gam.
Other: hold one finger up to susan. you???ll just be a second. you numbskull. you were given a very simple task. i could not have been more clear with you. now say, ???are you taking your medicine????
Andy: are you taking your med-meds?
Other: why can you not say exactly what i tell you? undo this. undo it. [robert and andy hang up phones]
Other: you didn???t say goodbye to your grandma.
Andy: we promised we???d never say goodbye.
Dwight: attention! i am now accepting memberships for dwight schrute???s gym for muscles. the first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Oscar: all i need is another gym. as if i don???t have enough drama.
Phyllis: we have a gym at home. it???s called the bedroom.
Oscar: who???s spotting who? don???t use the bike in the corner. that???s bruce???s. jeremy says???
Angela: enough oscar, enough.
Dwight: kelly?
Kelly: i have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
Dwight: that???s okay. i know how to build a business. you gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. one step at a time.
Toby: did you bring your passport with you?
Other: who walks around with their passport?
Toby: well, i do. always ready for adventure.
Other: have you had any?
Toby: no.
Andy: [sees susan is busy in the annex] hey, uh, guys. so robert doesn't want his wife working here. so now that she is, we have to drive her away.
Oscar: andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
Other: it was a mistake. but one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Kevin: how can we do that? she's simply wonderful.
Angela: this is all pathetic.
Andy: i am not asking, i am ordering.
Oscar: how mean are we talking about?
Andy: it would be great if she were gone by lunch. erin, you're up. find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
Erin: got it. i know exactly which stapler to give her.
Erin: here you go. [gives susan a tiny stapler]
Other: um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? because this seems a bit cramped and i don't have a computer.
Erin: well that's a sales desk.
Kevin: yeah. you need to be over here with us accountants. just sit here and be quiet. and if you have a question, just raise your hand. but i'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. i. don't. know.
Jim: no, i don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. i think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. i mean, it knows what it's doing.
Oscar: that's gerald. [hands phone to jim]
Jim: oh, wow. so cute.
Other: oh, that is so cute-
Phyllis: [grabs phone] aw... he's so tiny. is he in a ladle?
Oscar: yeah, he's in a ladle.
Erin: that's adorable. how on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Oscar: he did it himself.
Phyllis: is that ladle stainless or...
Oscar: oh, stainless. williams sonoma.
Other: excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [jim chuckles]
Oscar: it's not that kind of ladle.
Jim: very cute. [holds out the phone]
Other: aw, let me see-
Oscar: [grabs phone] ah, just the battery on these things. i'm sorry, i've got to recharge this.
Other: i get it. last time i had a job, i remember i hated the boss' wife. of course, she was married to robert.
Other: your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Other: andy! andy, could you step in here, please? we'll fix this.
Andy: [in robot voice] what is going on?
Other: [chuckles] please. andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. so, uh, if you'll excuse me, i should step out, get to the atm before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
Andy: okey-dokey, artichokey. you hate it, don't you?
Other: do you not want me here?
Andy: why would you say that?
Other: it's okay. i understand. i'm not sure how i would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
Andy: it's not that, exactly.
Other: but it is something.
Andy: let's just say that if you don't want to work here, i am totally prepared to respect that.
Other: why would you not want me working here?
Andy: i don't know. [chuckles]
Other: i think i understand what you're going through. my husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Andy: yes! the dude is an enigma.
Other: mm-hmm. so he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
Andy: ah... [stammers]
Other: got it.
Dwight: what do you think you're doing?
Darryl: getting my sweat on.
Dwight: i build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Darryl: i just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Dwight: i was watching you. you want to know how long it really was?
Darryl: no.
Dwight: eight minutes!
Darryl: dude, i'm gonna be here all week, right? five days a week, i figure i'll start slow.
Dwight: is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] i want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! i'm gonna make you look like lebron james!
Darryl: it's lejon brames.
Dwight: that's what i said.
Darryl: you know, get it right.
Dwight: i know.
Andy: [to susan] cameras...
Other: [enters] oh, still here. terrific.
Other: andy and i had a great conversation. and i just want to let you know that i am not going to be working here.
Other: well that's a shame.
Andy: it just was one of those things-
Other: is it? because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. which is fine.
Other: where did this come from? did andy say that?
Other: no, he did not, but i could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
Other: what's the struggle? he made a great call, hired a great person.
Other: you sure about that?
Other: absolutely.
Other: no games?
Other: no games.
Other: because andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Other: okay, enough of this. i mean, really, enough. it's gotten way out of hand. andrew, this is my wife. whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, i thank you for. but it is not welcome right now. just be honest.
Other: andy?
Andy: yes?
Other: why do you keep looking at my husband?
Other: andy, just answer the question.
Andy: no games?
Other: no games.
Andy: okay. i mean, it was kind of funny, actually. robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. i told her she could work here. under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]
Other: you lying son of a bitch!
Other: tell my wife you're lying.
Andy: i am lying. i am a compulsive liar.
Other: that's not true, is it?
Andy: no, it's not. i tell the truth most of the time and i was just telling the truth about your husband. jim knows. he was there.
Other: this is preposterous.
Other: robert...
Other: let's get jim in here. [jim shoves out of fram in his chair, robert looks for jim] where's jim?
Erin: he just rolled out and crawled out.
Other: can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? time to settle this.
Jim: [to hank who is closing the gate] oh wait, wait, wait! hold on, hold on. i just need to get through. just real quick. real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]
Other: [sees jim's abandoned car] that's weird. well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
Jim: [shoe falls while climbing ladder] oh. ow. ow. ow. [grunts] creed. i was never here, all right?
Other: okay. what about your friend?
Jim: oh boy.
Dwight: this is my gym, my rules. you do exactly as i say, no questions asked.
Darryl: yeah, i'm gonna ask questions and i might not do what you say.
Dwight: first thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. ready? get down on the floor.
Darryl: okay, i'm not doing that.
Dwight: really? too embarrassing for you? huh? you wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the fonz? well how do you think the fonz got so cool? he stretched his pelvic bowl!
Other: i didn't know darryl joined.
Darryl: looks that way.
Other: nice pelvic bowl. deep.
Other: hello jim. [jim tries to escape]
Andy: [grabs jim's leg] no, no. no, no, no! don't! damn it, tuna!
Other: so i think you know what we want to know.
Jim: do i?
Other: yes.
Jim: [mutters] i know, i do.
Andy: jim, i've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
Jim: i really wish i could help. i'm not really sure how i can...
Other: for god's sake, did robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Jim: that's the thing. see, i didn't want to get in the middle of this. still don't. but here's something: i feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Andy: [laughs] i think we've got ourselves an answer.
Other: no.
Andy: that makes complete sense. thank you all for a wonderful day.
Jim: perfect!
Other: jim...
Jim: yes?
Other: answer the question, please.
Jim: [sighs] i don't know what you want me to tell you. to be really honest, my wife works here. and i love it. she literally makes me work harder. she makes me smarter. she makes me remember why i'm here. and between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and i would love to leave this room and see her face. i would love it. i don't know how this helps, but it's just what i'm thinking.
Other: all right. thanks.
Jim: yes. all right. great. [leaves]
Andy: uh...
Other: yeah.
Andy: yep.
Other: [robert holds the door, she walks through] thank you. [leaves]
Other: [claps andy's shoulder] heh.
Other: andy.
Andy: hey, mrs. california.
Other: hey. uh, i'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
Andy: you know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. except for him. especially me.
Other: yeah, i thought we really hit it off.
Andy: yeah.
Other: well, different circumstances.
Andy: yeah.
Other: who knows?
Andy: who knows?
Other: maybe after all this settles down...
Andy: totally.
Other: it's a date.
Andy: hmm?
Dwight: you're nothing! you're so weak, you call yourself a man? huh?
Darryl: this doesn't help me. i don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Dwight: okay, fine. finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Darryl: dwight, come back and spot me.
Dwight: all right, i'll help you. but first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. what do you want?
Darryl: to push this bar up.
Dwight: no! because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. what is your goal?
Darryl: help me!
Dwight: what do you want!?!
Darryl: to look good for val!
Dwight: val kilmer? i don't buy it. that doesn't make any sense. wow... i figured out your goal. i am going to make you the buffest dude val kilmer has ever seen.
Other: they say that if you can strengthen your core, it improves your sexual performance. so, you will find me on the ab-blaster. and then you will find me blasting...uh, a very nice young woman.
Other: gotta get in shape. i'm doing ironman next month. and i want him to be attracted to me.
Dwight: hey, what are you listening to?
Other: steve martin. [laughs, then falls] uh, i'm fine. [grunts]
Erin: um, where's the shower?
Dwight: there is no shower.
Other: there isn't?
Dwight: what does this look like, a shower store? get lost.
Oscar: you have got to be kidding me! no shower?!
Dwight: exercise lengthens life. improves mood, boosts sex drive, and i've already covered the bm of it all. it's miraculous the effect that i will have on their lives.
Andy: so, roberto californio doesn't want to work with his wife. i get it. and, he wants to give his wife a job. totally get it. what i am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.
Other: i love my wife.
Jim: this whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. i'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. you know stanley's tie is really the story of the day...
Other: it's my birthday.
Jim: ok, so that's a disaster. luckily have a two-part plan. one, run. two, hide. it's pretty smart, right? [walks into vance refrigeration office] hi, how you doing? i'm jim halpert from across the hall. we are redoing our supply closet and i was wondering if i could take a look at yours for some ideas.
Other: let me just check with bob.
Jim: you absolutely should. he said it was ok, so till you get him, i'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]
Other: [on phone] bob? jim just went into the closet.
Andy: ugh! he's always one step ahead of us! how does he do that?
Other: this is insulting!
Other: this whole accusation is insulting. come on.
Andy: [singing as if he were the dolls in his office] christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [normal voice] wow. thanks guys, that sounded amazing. hi, i'm andy bernard and i am the first office santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
Andy: who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
Other: holiday wishes.
Andy: what's that, stanley?
Other: we know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
Andy: it is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
Other: i've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic christmases. a honolulu christmas, a pulp fiction christmas, a muslim christmas, moroccan christmas. mo-rocca christmas. i don't want it. christmas is christmas is christmas is christmas.
Jim: i got stanley tickets to see lewis black for his birthday. ...might not have been the best idea.
Other: i don't want no kwanza wreath, i don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. and who's that black santa for?! i don't care! i know santa ain't black! i could care less. i want christmas! just give me plain baby jesus, lying in a manger, christmas!
Other: what is the status on my wish?
Andy: fulfilled! brought my bicycle, so i can be your designated driver later. in the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
Dwight: what about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Andy: that, i cannot do, but i did get you an acre of property on the moon.
Dwight: where? dark side or light side?
Andy: light side.
Dwight: is it by the sea of tranquility?
Andy: as a matter of fact, yes. directly adjacent....beachfront.
Dwight: thank you, andy.
Andy: so, who's wish is next? oh, what about santa's wish? my biggest wish is that you all get along well with jessica....c'mon guys, jessica?...jim, tell 'em who jessica is.
Jim: she's not your grandmother, is she?
Andy: ugh! gam-gam's name is ruth, jim, you should know. i introduced you on speakerphone that time?
Jim: yeah.
Andy: jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. only thing that's not serious, by the way? our repartee.
Other: that's great. when you know you know. hey, what's ruth's deal, man?
Andy: totally out of your league. so in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near gam-gam.
Erin: i love jessica, and i haven't even met her yet. it's like we don't even need to meet, you know? i already love you. stay home.
Kelly: i just want you to know that i will be mean to jessica if you want me to be.
Erin: oh no, no. it's fine, kelly.
Kelly: it's really no problem. i was already planning on being mean to her.
Erin: that's ok, i don't want you to do that.
Other: [laughing] hello, ah. merry christmas, erin. kelly, happy pancha ganapati.
Kelly: eww, what is that?
Other: the five day hindu celebration in december honoring the god ganesh, patron of the arts.
Kelly: cool.
Kevin: hey, man.
Other: hey! [kevin embraces robert in a tight hug] oh!
Kevin: how ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Oscar: kevin?
Other: i actually appreciate the human intimacy. feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
Kevin: yeah.
Other: it's been ten days since i had sexual intercourse.
Andy: well you came to the right place....ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
Other: i hope so. the corporate party was wretched. i am so tired of the black eyed peas. it's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. it's rap for people who don't like rap. it's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to andy in santa costume]
Andy: oh, thank you.
Andy: well, i hate to have to take my santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words ???hard ass???] but, this is serious. it's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Dwight: fine with me. jim can leave anytime he wants. goodbye.
Jim: it wasn't me.
Andy: it wasn't either of you.
Jim: kathy wants to leave our clump?
Andy: sh sh sh sh! don't look. who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. she or he.
Dwight: i just wanna say, this is not my fault. ok? the weak always bully the strong. contrary to what you see in the media. i am always acting in self-defense. occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches jim in the arm]
Jim: ow, what are you doing? [jim fights back]
Andy: hey! hey! respect the hat!
Jim: pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Andy: alright. i'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....mo-nay.
Jim: what was that?
Dwight: what is it?
Andy: money....you both have sizable christmas bonuses coming your way. if i catch either of you messing with the other, i will give both bonuses to the other person.
Jim: can't do that.
Dwight: no, absolutely not.
Andy: you need consequences. ok? i want you both walking on eggshells.
Other: hi. i'm jessica. i'm looking for andy?
Erin: jessica. yes. we don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs jessica] i'm erin.
Other: oh! [laughs] oof!
Erin: sorry, hi, i hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
Other: oh.
Andy: my ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? and not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.
Andy: hey! jess, erin, i hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses jessica on the cheek] hi.
Other: hi.
Andy: hey everyone! i want you to meet jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at bryn mawr.
Erin: wow.
Andy: erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
Other: oh, that's great. backbone of the office.
Erin: which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
Andy: what?
Other: oh.
Erin: scoliosis. had to wear a back brace for three years but i never did. [jessica laughs, erin exaggerates back curve]
Andy: oh no.
Other: ah..[laughs]
Andy: ut oh, it's kicking in. spontaneous scoliosis.
Other: spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]
Erin: oh.
Darryl: this thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
Other: thank you.
Darryl: alright.
Other: alright.
Darryl: oh yeah, and um there's a christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
Other: isn't that just for popsicles?
Darryl: popsicles?
Other: yeah, upstairs people? cause you got a stick up your butt?
Other: ah! see, i, i, i thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] i, in my, i...
Darryl: well you should definitely come. the foreman always comes. plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
Other: you had me at ???clookies.??? i can't wait to find out what they are.
Other: what should i wear?
Darryl: oh, it's nice, it's real nice. people get dressed up.
Other: i will look so handsome for you, darryl.
Jim: ah...[sees dwight's wallet and open email] i'm gonna s- [see's dwight watching from break room]
Jim: dwight really wants my bonus. he's trying to entrap me. oh god, now i can't drink at this thing....i get really pranky when i drink.
Other: erin, what can i get for you?
Erin: uh, do you have cola? kirkland if you have it.
Other: now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? did some small part of you want something a little stronger? ryan, kevin, phyllis, oscar, come and take these shots!
Ryan: yes!
Oscar: yes!
Ryan: will do.
Other: the fifth one is for you, erin. you could take it or leave it. to take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. to leave it would be fine too.
Phyllis: one, two three! [group takes shots]
Kevin: yes.
Erin: ok. [takes shot, group laughs]
Other: mmm. wow.
Erin: whoo! jiminy christmas!
Other: jiminey christmas indeed.
Erin: hit 'er up.
Other: oh.
Kevin: oh yes.
Ryan: whoo!
Erin: yeah! [laughs]
Oscar: wow.
Jim: [on phone] uh, yeah. i just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. the security code is nine two seven. ok great. thank you very much. bye.
Jim: so dwight did take the bait. he used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
Dwight: [laughing] boom!
Ryan: but look, it's christmas, so you're allowed...[val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. um, you're allowed to do...
Kevin: good cookie.
Darryl: i meant dressed up compared to normal. you usually dress like a ghost-buster.
Other: ok.
Darryl: i thought you'd wear a sweater.
Other: since when does a sweater mean ???dressed up???? am i your grandson?
Darryl: come on, stay, alright? it's good for people to get to know you.
Other: as a contestant on dancing with the stars, maybe.
Erin: [imitating stanley] i want.. my sugar free cookie, and then i want a sugar cookie. [group laughs] and then i want my nap!
Other: that's right. [laughs]
Erin: whoo! [group laughs] thank you.
Other: she, she is remarkable.
Andy: edgy impressions.
Erin: thank you.
Andy: how many drinks have you had tonight? i can't be driving everybody home.
Erin: a thousand.
Andy: whoa! maybe you should take a break.
Erin: [serious] maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] just kidding!
Dwight: ah! i've been attacked! oh my god! oh! someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Toby: oh my god.
Dwight: yeah, i was just sitting here at my desk and i, i reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden i was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
Jim: i wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
Dwight: or who in this office knows that i have access and is trying to set me up?
Jim: hmm...
Toby: you know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest chad flendermen novel. a murder for framing.
Toby: chad flendermen. just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to oxford. so. just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on air force one. oh and he's also the world's leading egyptologist.
Angela: toby! nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
Toby: no, no, no, no, no. women chase him. he misses his wife.
Dwight: hello? lacerated hand here folks.
Jim: nice try, this is ridiculous.
Dwight: oh is it really? two separate times you have set me up to believe i was being recruited by the cia.
Jim: three times.
Dwight: you see?
Andy: jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
Jim: andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
Toby: fingerprints can be planted. you know with a severed hand...
Kelly: do you think that's what happened? do you think he used a severed hand?
Jim: ok, you know what? why don't we just call animal control...
Dwight: might wanna run that by angela cause it's so cute.
Angela: no. porcupines don't have souls. they're like dogs.
Jim: [on phone] yes, i'm calling from dunder mifflin. we have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
Dwight: come down right away!
Jim: [on phone]uh, i don't know, let me ask. [to dwight] uh, were you quilled?
Dwight: yes, i was quilled.
Jim: and what's it's name?
Dwight: henrietta.
Jim: oops. [hangs up]
Andy: what? ...alright, get her out of here, dwight.
Erin: hey, guys. i just wanted to say. come here! i'm so happy you guys are together. ok? [andy and jessica laugh] and you both have such beautiful hair.
Other: [laughs] thank you.
Erin: i hope you guys get married....and who knows? maybe at the wedding, i meet someone.
Andy: ok!
Erin: and later on tonight, i hope i see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes andy and jessica's faces together.] ah! [laughs] ok, well i'm gonna go do another reverse spit. that's how the cool kids say ???get a drink???. [blows kisses and dances away]
Other: that's uh, that's the girl you dated.
Andy: um, yeah, she's not always like that. it's um...
Other: no, she, she seems fine.
Andy: yeah, uh, excuse me.
Other: ok.
Andy: yep. [leaves jessica to talk to erin] hey!
Erin: hey.
Andy: have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
Erin: every martini has an olive.
Andy: ok...maybe i should make you some oatmeal or something.
Kevin: i don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, i'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Erin: hey, i never told you my christmas wish.
Andy: ah, ok.
Erin: it's about you.
Andy: that's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
Erin: [slurring slightly] it's that i wish jessica was dead.
Andy: you you, wait. you mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
Erin: i wish she was in a graveyard! under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Andy: hey, you know, you can't say that, ok? that's my girlfriend that you're talking about. you and i are not together anymore. you need to get over it! take your wish back.
Erin: too late! it's already been wished! and you promised it would come true. you wrote it in an email! so, which one are you? a murderer or a liar? [andy leaves]
Kevin: hey.
Erin: hey.
Kevin: so, there was talk of oatmeal.
Phyllis: you know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. you look like a, a princess.
Other: yeah. thanks.
Andy: i swear...
Other: did you not...
Andy: i was too embarrassed! [group laughs]
Jim: hey guys, sorry to interrupt, i uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of cici with devil doodles] need to talk to somebody about it. can you believe that?
Phyllis: is that cici?
Jim: yes. it is.
Andy: um.
Phyllis: that's awful.
Andy: cici is jim's daughter.
Other: oh my god. how could somebody do that?
Jim: i know, i mean the way i see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. not my kid though.
Oscar: who did this? who did this? do you know who did this?
Jim: i don't-
Andy: i know who did this....dwight.
Phyllis: dwight?
Jim: yeah.
Andy: dwight.
Oscar: no!
Phyllis: he should pay.
Andy: yeah. he is gonna pay. this is fire-able.
Jim: o...k.
Andy: it's, i mean.
Jim: let me just see that one more time. yep, you know what? i know who my friends are, now. but i shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, i don't even really care about this picture, it???s a little out of focus. it was probably an accident, right? like...
Oscar: that's no accident.
Jim: right. you're right. so maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Phyllis: what?
Oscar: what?
Jim: i'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....merry merry.
Dwight: enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] this is christmas. [christmas eve by trans-siberian orchestra plays. dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, creed and nate join in as shots show various gift giving] yeah!!!! christmas!!!!
Jim: you alright, santa?
Andy: you know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
Jim: yes.
Andy: do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
Jim: two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? yes, yeah.
Andy: no...i don't, hmm, i don't know.
Jim: ok.
Andy: by the way, i'm not gonna mess with you and dwight's bonuses. i think it's causing more problems. so just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
Jim: alright. i will definitely do that.
Andy: alright, i'll tell dwight.
Jim: you know what? you're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Andy: christmas miracles do happen.
Jim: yes. they totally do.
Ryan: you can't click on these kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
Kelly: well help me, ok? just, uh take...
Ryan: i'm trying but you need to-
Erin: hey.
Kelly: yo.
Erin: game on.
Kelly: on it.
Other: [group laughing] i don't know what i was thinking, it was awful...
Kelly: jessica, did you just fart? [group stops laughing]
Kelly: and that, is how it's done.
Erin: i would like another alcohol.
Other: let's you and i take a walk. oscar, you're in charge of the bar.
Oscar: what? i haven't bar tended in forever. oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. um, i need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
Other: your heart is broken. so is mine.
Erin: and...
Other: and what?
Erin: and you have any advice or anything?
Other: no [laughs] my god.
Erin: ...help me feel better...
Other: i've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, i'm not sure i'm the best person to give love advice....i was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
Other: when you do your makeup,
Other: uh huh.
Other: how long you, does it take usually? cause...
Other: um, it ta-, um it depends.
Toby: ???..chad flendermen's kryptonite. [darryl walks up to toby and val in a tuxedo]
Other: whoa. we got a real clarence thomas here.
Darryl: hi.
Other: i'll see you at home?
Andy: ok great.
Other: ok
Andy: perfect.
Other: bye [kiss]...i still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
Andy: i would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
Other: oh
Other: either he drives or i drive. now i'm drunk and mad.
Other: ok [laughs] bye.
Andy: ok, bye. [helps meredith off the floor] alright meredith,
Other: thank you santa.
Andy: you bet.
Andy: thank god erin's getting a ride home with robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than robert, i mean, what a stand up guy, you know? i mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
Andy: let's go, let's go.
Other: i know, i'm coming, i'm coming, i'm coming, i'm coming, i'm coming.
Andy: hang on.
Other: alright. [andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Andy: what?
Other: whoa! my stuff!
Andy: what is all that?
Other: it's my valuables!
Andy: it's junk!
Other: this is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Andy: you're a hoarder. my god!
Other: no i'm not, i'm gonna sell it on ebay! no no no, you be careful. be careful.
Andy: ah! my santa suit's stuck.
Dwight: [laughs while spray painting ???jim is awesome??? on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] what are we gonna do with all that bonus money, henrietta? huh?
Other: where are we? this ain't my street.
Andy: sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.
Other: ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Andy: oh my god.
Other: wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
Andy: meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
Other: erin, it was great fun tonight. take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.
Erin: thank you, goodnight.
Other: what are you smiling for? you thinkin' what i'm thinkin'?
Andy: i'm sure i am not. let's get you home.
Other: ow! take it easy.
Andy: whoo.
Dwight: [yawns, ???idiot??? is written on his forehead] ah, man. ah, fell asleep, took a nap. hey guys, ah i feel refreshed now. how's it goin?
Oscar: dwight.
Dwight: took a little nap right next to jim's desk. i feel so good right now. mmm, cookies. what's everyone staring at?
Jim: oh man, i was supposed to tell dwight something......c'mon, jim. [shakes head] i got nothin'.
Other: where can i get a drink? oh...
Andy: oh, uh. well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11am. it's just...common...decency.
Other: par for the course. par for the...freaking course. i'll be in the party room having a cookie until 11. haha! yule-log.
Other: not destroyed. no..... not destructive. quite...off-kilter, sure. but... that's too vague. [long pause] erratic. darkly erratic. [laughs awkwardly] that's my mood.
Other: cake?...you seem a little down.
Other: i am. [laughs] i'm a mess.
Other: how about i fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Other: oh, that sounds nice.
Other: maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...
Other: lovely. wait, where is this taking place?
Other: the murphy bed of my basement.
Other: what...is happening to me? [pause] the lines in your haggard face are paths that lead nowhere. your hair is the fire of hell. [hugs meredith] i sincerely hope you find a sexual partner tonight.
Andy: it's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
Jim: cathy wants to leave our clump?
Andy: don't look. who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. she or he.
Dwight: hey. enjoy your new clump.
Other: thanks.
Dwight: it's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
Other: yeah.
Dwight: uh huh.
Jim: sorry it didn't work out. hope you find what you're looking for.
Other: no, i just have more room.
Jim: that's ok.
Dwight: you'll be fine over there.
Erin: [talking loudly] sorry guys, jim! this package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?
Jim: that'd be great, thank you. [erin throws package, it hits kathy. she thinks it was jim who threw it]
Dwight: so, i got this bucket from jim's garage and i filled it with everything disgusting. except excrement. i can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on kathy] dammit kathy!
Andy: for the past month, i have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and i intend to make good on every single one of them.
Andy: oh, i see.
Andy: now look, i may not have a great laugh like santa, or a flying sled. but tell you what i do have. a prius, a heart of freaking gold....
Kevin: this.
Andy: alright, you got it.
Andy: ...and an american express green card.
Andy: ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.
Ryan: i'd be satisfied with eight.
Andy: well i'll do you one better.
Ryan: nine?
Andy: i got you health insurance.
Ryan: oh, neat.
Andy: yeah! right? but with great perks come great responsibility, so i'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.
Ryan: oh, great.
Andy: yes!
Kevin: oh yeah!
Other: aw!
Dwight: knew it! i knew it! soon as i heard that wrapper.
Oscar: you really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
Kevin: i can't help it, oscar. it's just really good. [takes another bite] oh yeah!
Jim: all right, not bad at all. i think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. get it all out now if you have to.
Andy: it was a raccoon! eating a hamburger like a person!
Dwight: you need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Jim: okay, done.
Erin: [shows bloody hand] does anyone have a first aid kit?
Darryl: check out this song i wrote: i'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter]
Jim: all right, here we go! everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
Andy: [writing on board] love letters, yes! i love it. what else can be done with paper?
Jim: you can write a book about chairs.
Andy: books! excellent, jim.
Oscar: andy, please! please, just stop. you can do infinite things with paper-
Andy: [gasps] shh! did you hear that? infinity! there is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]
Jim: very nice. very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
Andy: i'm talking about you guys! who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? let's get high on our own supply!
Angela: andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
Andy: yes!
Andy: robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. that's today. and we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. and i can't afford to keep buying paper from us. so today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter i need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
Dwight: animals, machines, vast virtual armies. all of these things i have successfully managed. the only thing i haven't managed is people. i saw an ad on the sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. i spoke to robert california about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. so, like a spanish conquistador, i have come to florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
Dwight: dwight schrute for robert california!
Other: oh, hello mr. schrute. i'll tell him you're here. can i get you anything at all?
Dwight: i'm not here to be given anything. i'm here to take what is mine.
Other: ooh. i'm glad you're on our team. here, please have a seat.
Other: dwight? what are you doing here?
Dwight: gabe? you don't know?
Other: course i know.
Dwight: hmm. impressive office you have here. surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Other: corporate says to me, ???gabe, we need you in scranton.??? scranton says, ???gabe, go back down to florida. you're needed there.??? so, tuesdays and thursdays, i'm up there. mondays, wednesdays and fridays, i'm down here. i can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
Other: dwight.
Dwight: robert.
Other: you made it.
Dwight: yes.
Other: impressive initiative. i don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [gabe laughs] well, uh, let me settle in and i'll be with you shortly.
Dwight: very good.
Andy: hey c-span. so my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' those were his words.
Oscar: gosh, andy, you had a great quarter. okay? robert will understand. eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
Andy: so make that error!
Oscar: andy, no-
Kevin: hey! i can make that error.
Oscar: [clicks tongue] aw...
Andy: well, it's just, i know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
Kevin: no, i-
Andy: it's just, i really need a real accountant on this. [to oscar] what do you say?
Oscar: i'm leaving early today because tonight i have a trivia contest in philadelphia.
Andy: oh.
Oscar: any other crunch time, i would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your ceo, but tonight is triviocalypse!
Andy: what?
Oscar: it's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. there's a thousand dollar prize. i'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
Andy: you know what? go. have fun.
Andy: there's a trivia contest at a bar in philadelphia.
Jim: stop right there. i love it.
Darryl: i'm in.
Andy: i didn't even say what it is.
Darryl: it's trivia.
Jim: in philadelphia.
Andy: but here's the best part. the prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
Jim: that's a great idea.
Darryl: that's a great plan.
Andy: yeah? you like it?
Jim: yeah.
Andy: all right.
Jim: all right, good stuff.
Andy: i'm so psyched you guys are into it because i thought- i was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'
Darryl: you just made a good idea, a great idea.
Andy: there is one problem with this plan.
Darryl: what?
Andy: we'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
Other: [on the phone] you can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. all right. [hangs up]
Dwight: gabe, i always wondered what it is you did around here. now i found out. you're the bagel guy.
Other: yeah. but not just bagels. all unwanted problems. question: what's the most important appliance in your house?
Dwight: meat grinder.
Other: [makes buzzer sound] too slow. it's the toilet. and i am the toilet of this office. i flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. and, just like a toilet, i am essential.
Dwight: you know, gabe? you could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. god bless you. you're an american classic.
Other: dwight. today is not my day at all, i'm afraid. i'm not going to be able to meet with you, but i'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our coo.
Dwight: but i can give you this pitch in one minute-
Other: no, he's going to meet with you later. no, no, no. i don't want you to rush it, okay? trust me. meet with bill. he's a great person to know. i'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]
Other: ceo to coo. what a difference a letter makes.
Dwight: still an important position. still a chief.
Other: you're really going to like bill. he, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [dwight sighs, gabe's phone rings] hallway phone, gabe lewis speaking.
Other: gabe, listen to me. don't bother bill with this. he has to go put out a fire on the home front. just wait twenty minutes and then i want you to listen to dwight's pitch. make him feel valued. make him feel heard.
Other: your wish is my command.
Other: it's a command.
Oscar: i don't believe this. what are you doing here, andy?
Andy: you left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. how would you like to be captain of the dunder-mifflin team? although i reserve the right to overrule you.
Oscar: what? no!
Andy: i've got a quota to hit. i don't care how i hit it.
Oscar: and you guys thought this was a good idea?
Jim: i thought it was a fun idea.
Darryl: there were times on the two and a half hour drive when i experienced doubt. that's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
Andy: wait, what? everyone in here is gay?
Oscar: yes! it's a gay bar! so you guys want to go home now?
Other: no. nah.
Oscar: what does this say about you? that you followed me here? that you think you're going to win your sales quota? at a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Andy: it says that i believe that my staff's intelligence and that i'm willing to try anything. [oscar???s friend walks up] not anything.
Oscar: good luck.
Andy: uh, all right. we need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. we need an a-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. so you guys all know yourselves.
Other: good-timers follow me.
Phyllis: backups. [jim goes to join the backups]
Other: go on, kid. you know you don't belong here.
Andy: a-team.
Jim: okay.
Andy: all right, everybody. nice self-awareness. except... [looks at kevin, who has joined the a-team]
Kevin: okay. [leaves]
Jim: there's a table over here.
Other: all right, first question everyone: ray charles famously had this state on his mind. what is its capital?
Andy: oh, we got this!
Other: let's reverse engineer this. you're a black singer. where do you go? somewhere where you're a novelty. alaska?
Other: atlanta.
Phyllis: oh i know you think that, because that's where the olympics were held.
Other: my cousins were actually at those olympics.
Other: keep talking all you want.
Kevin: how am i supposed to know what was on his mind? ooh, what do blind people think about?
Erin: okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
Other: okay, time's up. let's get the boards up. 'atlanta, georgia' is the correct answer. [kevin holds up ???what is...see-attle???]
Other: hey man, uh, look. unfortunately, bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
Dwight: [sniffs] there's no fires within eight miles of here.
Other: well, it's nine miles away. i'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
Dwight: what? no, no. excuse me! lady! get anyone from the coo's office on the phone this instant!
Other: this must be very frustrating.
Other: i can see you in the jungle now.
Other: okay, now, you're not an all-star of the nba, but you did get your game on when you won the nba's sixth man of the year award in 2011. who are you?
Andy: jim, darryl. your time to shine.
Jim: shawn marion.
Darryl: yes, shawn marion.
Ryan: that doesn't sound right. i want to say, ladameon washington.
Jim: wrong, for so many reasons.
Phyllis: well, i know elizabeth taylor's sixth man was richard burton. is that helpful?
Other: that's it. i'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
Kevin: ron artest, kelly.
Kelly: no, it's lamar odom. if it'd been ron artest, it would have come up in dancing with the stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. lamar winning sixth man was a big storyline on chloe and lamar.
Other: all right, boards up. let's see who got it. 'lamar odom' is what we were looking for. 'lamar odom' thank you. [scattered cheers]
Jim: oh my god. lamar odom, yes.
Kevin: nicely done!
Andy: you're my sports guys! you're espn, you're espn classic, ryan is msnbc. i'm e!, tlc and oxygen.
Darryl: chill, man. this plan is airtight.
Dwight: so it's a very simple argument of why i should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. bottom line, i know the product. i get it!
Other: well, you got my vote.
Dwight: oh my god.
Other: i know.
Dwight: most of all, i believe that character is destiny. and my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
Other: what?
Dwight: what's with the smile?
Other: you're doing great. you know, so good.
Dwight: and my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
Other: dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. put your hand on my hand. flush! [gabe makes a flushing motion, dwight twists gabe's arm] ow!
Dwight: take me to robert.
Other: ow! he went home.
Dwight: take me to his house.
Other: uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
Dwight: you know where it is. lead me there.
Other: ow! ow! stephanie, help!
Dwight: listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. i'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. let's go.
Other: excuse me, sir, on the dunder-mifflin a-team? excuse me, sir?
Ryan: yeah?
Other: i'm sure you're just checking your grindr account... [laughter] but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules.
Ryan: okay, i'm turning it off.
Other: okay, you're not turning it off.
Ryan: i won't look at it.
Other: sir?
Ryan: i can't- i can't not touch it.
Other: okay, then we're going to have to take it away. [employee takes the phone] thank you.
Ryan: look, i can't, i can't not have my phone. i'm sorry. i want to be with my phone. [leaves]
Other: all right, guys. after nine rounds, let's check the scores. in first place, with nine points, it's aesop's foibles. [oscar's team touches fingers] the queerenstein bears have seven points. [a team of hairy men growl] dunder-mifflin a-team has four points.
Jim: [claps] all right.
Other: d.m. backup team has three points. the einsteins have eight points. [the 'just-for-fun??? dunder-mifflin team cheers] ladies gaga have five points. [more cheering]
Andy: so the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of kevin, meredith, erin and kelly. do i like these odds? my answer is no.
Dwight: which one is it?
Other: i don't know. all i know is the building.
Dwight: robert! robert california! robert!
Other: dwight! how nice of gabe to show you where i live. come around. 102.
Other: all right guys, time's up. who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? looks like everyone gets a point for albert einstein. oh wait. except for the einsteins. that's all right. which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. so let's get everyone some bells. in third place we have the einsteins.
Kevin: oh yeah!
Kelly: what! [cheers]
Other: in second place, we have the queerenstein bears.
Other: whoo! let's go!
Other: and, in first place, is aesop's foibles.
Other: whoo!
Darryl: yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
Other: ring it in when you know it. first question: this man had a fatwa declared on him when- [erin rings bell] einsteins?
Other: what?
Erin: what is it?
Other: what?
Erin: i did my part, babe. i'm just the bell girl. [oscar rings bell]
Other: aesop's?
Oscar: salman rushdie.
Other: salman rushdie is correct. [applause] heading out to sea, sailors. on a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what? [erin rings bell]
Other: princess ding-dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Erin: flying jib.
Other: flying jib is correct for the einsteins. [cheers and applause]
Other: shalom. [sighs] give us just a minute. stu and i are just finishing up our lesson. trust me. one nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. [grunt] i could go to the gym three times a week or i can wrestle stu once a month. [slaps the mat, they wrestle]
Other: grab my knee!
Other: yay robert!
Other: guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
Other: according to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among american adolescents.
Other: [rings bell] boom! adhd!
Other: no. [another bell rings]
Other: wrong. the answer is dyslexia!
Other: that's correct for the einsteins. [cheers and applause]
Andy: [dances] whoo! yeah!
Other: sir-
Andy: go einsteins!
Other: dial it back, this isn't tail feathers, okay? [laughter]
Other: they haven't really improved on the oreo, have they?
Dwight: no thank you.
Other: sit down, dwight.
Dwight: let me tell you why i should be the next manager with a riddle: a manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. the hostess says, 'table for one?' how is this possible?
Other: you were dining alone? all those people are you?
Dwight: yes, exactly. riddle number two: who is going-
Other: ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. it would be wasted on a manager's job. and florida, you don't want to live here. even i don't want to live here. that's why i'm always at my place in scranton. florida is america's basement: it's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. alligators are dinosaurs, dwight. you know that, right?
Dwight: n... it's complicated.
Other: [holds a medal to the light] this medal was my grandfather's. he received it for acts of courage. for excellence. it's a tribute one man gives another. i could give you a job, dwight. why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]
Dwight: it's a job interview, not a flea market.
Other: dwight, the job is not right for you. now, when something comes along that is right for you, i'll try you out. now get the hell out of my place.
Dwight: yes.
Other: final round. last two teams squaring off. i hope you're ready to play doctor. our question is about health and the human body.
Andy: oh, come on!
Other: the standard american analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight? [bell rings]
Kevin: three hundred pounds!
Other: point for the einsteins. [applause] here's your final question. cinephiles, put on your memory berets: this 2001 masterpiece from gilles paquet-brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray.
Oscar: [rings bell, answers in french] le titre du film est le scaphandre et le papillon.
Other: yes!
Other: i'm sorry, no. over to the einsteins.
Kevin: [rings bell] les jolies choses.
Other: are you sure?
Kevin: marie cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Other: the einsteins win it! [applause]
Oscar: no! come on!
Kevin: look, i know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. so if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
Other: welcome to the stonewall alliance trivia championships! first prize is forty-five hundred dollars!
Kevin: let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Other: riboflavin.
Kevin: [holds up 'robitussin'] riboflavin?
Other: michigan. [kevin holds up 'a mitten'] the president of the united states is 'p.o.t.u.s.' [kevin holds up 'p.o.t.a.t.o.???] john steinbeck wrote the grapes of wrath. [kevin holds up 'the california raisins']
Kelly: cause it's like, really...
Andy: einsteins! great work.
Kevin: thank you.
Andy: you know what i thought would be fun? is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? since only one of us needs to win, maybe i can get kevin and kelly and put together an all-star team?
Oscar: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! andy, there is no switching teams.
Kevin: andy, we're fine. we don't wanna switch. we're already like, the perfect unit.
Andy: alright. well just stay focused, try to concentrate.
Other: whoo! brought some brain food.
Erin: yeah!
Kelly: having fun.
Other: one, two, three...[team takes shots]
Kevin: when i dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that i was nuts. well who's laughing now?
Other: say ???shalom??? to your shrubs on this jewish holiday that celebrates the new year for trees.
Kelly: tu bishvat!
Other: that's correct.
Other: whoo!
Other: point for the einsteins.
Kelly: hey, is it true that you're not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of tu bishvat?
Other: uh, i don't think so.
Kelly: i knew it. i knew it. i knew it. ryan lies to me and says he has a whole jewish holiday for an entire month.....
Oscar: it gets better, kids. it gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Andy: alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? that would be amazing.
Jim: andy, it's the last day of the quarter. we've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Andy: not helping, tuna.
Other: yeah, i'm sitting on twenty-five hundred in sales i can make at any time but those are my wait till the separation is legal sales.
Andy: we gotta figure this out. think of the look on robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.
Kevin: oh, will we get to see that look?
Andy: no, that's why...that's why i said think of it.
Jim: andy, we're gonna do our best. but you know what? at the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
Other: yeah.
Angela: yeah, it is, andy.
Andy: have i mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and robert] took me two weeks.
Dwight: oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] what is this, a meatball? really? [stanley laughs]
Jim: it's always more fun to mess with dwight with an audience. that was usually pam so now that she's out i had to find someone else. turns out that stanley is quite the comedy fan. but not everything makes him laugh. he has very specific tastes. through a painstaking process of trial and error, i've found out what he likes. and it's really weird.
Dwight: jim, come on! that's so juvenile! what the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
Other: you've been meatballed! [laughs]
Dwight: ugh.
Other: are you ready for some meatball?
Dwight: aw, man. [stanley laughs] this is not very clever, jim.
Jim: i know.
Other: look for your stapler!
Dwight: [dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] really jim? really? very funny.
Other: [to phyllis] oh okay. good night. [climbs in to dwight's car] what's the haul?
Dwight: thirty-two meatballs.
Other: good day.
Dwight: that idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Other: we'll never have to buy meatballs again.
Erin: [phone rings] dunder mifflin. jessica, hi! how are you? oh yay, that's so great to hear.
Erin: i'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. they have their life and i have mine. i'm taking an italian class. so far i've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but i do monday, wednesday, friday from seven to nine.
Erin: i will patch you through right now. you sound really pretty today. okay.
Andy: jessica! i love you! that's a message from my mom.
Andy: my parents met jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. i know, whoa! pump the breaks, bernard, too early! i get it. i just, you know, i'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. i haven't proposed to anyone in years... mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
Jim: [robert is looking at pictures of a house online] whoa, looks pretty nice. got a little bit of a shining vibe, though.
Oscar: oh, who needs a house that size?
Dwight: big. stupid. pure chump bait.
Other: i'm selling the house, actually.
Jim: you know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
Other: it's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and i've got the most expensive house on the market. the one percent are suffering too, people. i wanted it to be my playboy mansion. a temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of eyes wide shut, mind you. then i met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. the ultimate insult? they're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [jim laughs] does my turmoil amuse you, jim?
Jim: i'm sorry, i thought you were making a joke.
Other: what could you possibly have found funny in what i said? what was the joke you thought you heard?
Jim: i guess i thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
Other: oh yes. how hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. very funny, jim. i get it.
Andy: um, i'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
Other: a beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. i think i'm entitled to the occasional bad day.
Andy: well, please tell susan we all say hi.
Kevin: dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [robert laughs]
Oscar: kevin, no.
Other: what, as some sort of last hoorah?
Kevin: yeah. all of us in the pool, saying hoorah. maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
Other: you know i suppose someone should enjoy the place before i hand it over to the staging experts at remax tomorrow.  let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. let's just call it a get-together. and let's say no food.
Kevin: hey oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Oscar: that was you, kevin.
Kevin: it was me.
Other: you going tonight, kiddo? cause i can give you a lift.
Erin: oh, i don't know, meredith. it seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
Other: it's no problem. you live right near me.
Erin: how do you know where i live?
Other: andy followed you home after the christmas party.
Erin: why?
Other: he wanted to make sure california didn't put it in you.
Erin: oh. come on.
Erin: wow. andy's such a weird stalker. following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? i should get a restraining order. [squeaks]
Angela: [sticks a hand in the pool] oh, it is warm.
Other: it's almost too warm.
Other: i'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
Ryan: oh, so close. eighty-one.
Other: [to cathy] well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
Other: [to jim] hey, late guy.
Jim: hey. wow. just stopping by. got another party to go to. a wife and two kids at home party.
Andy: oh.
Jim: dj pam halpert is spinning some serious radio disney tonight.
Jim: you're looking at the master of leaving parties early. they key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. i don't mean to brag, but new year's eve, i was home by nine.
Jim: robert, just wanted to grab you one second. this place is amazing, by the way.
Other: you should see the whole thing.
Jim: i bet i should. [takes cell phone photo] that's beautiful, i'm going to email that to you.
Other: i'm just about to give the tour.
Jim: all right-
Other: join us. you must see what you were laughing about.
Jim: i must...
Other: [looks at pool] wow.
Andy: [hides ring] yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.
Other: [sees andy's hand in his pocket] what are you doing?
Andy: hmm? flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]
Other: gross. i'm getting a drink. do you want anything?
Andy: no, i'm good.
Erin: [runs to andy] funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. hi.
Andy: hi.
Erin: how is everything? how's your car?
Andy: it's great. you know. reliable. great mileage.
Erin: is that so? how about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? maybe get caught in the rain?
Andy: well, i can't. i'm going skiing with jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
Erin: oh, like a goodbye trip.
Andy: no. what?
Other: hey.
Erin: hi.
Erin: i guess andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. but, if he was jealous once before then maybe i can make him jealous again. just not with robert. he told me he was a ride i wouldn't survive, and i believe him.
Darryl: val. you made it.
Other: yup, yup.
Darryl: uh oh, look at this. red plastic cup, red plastic cup. how about that?
Other: you know, you are just as dumb at night.
Darryl: mmm. [they clink cups]
Andy: all right, theres- this would be no problem. i could swim under, one breath.
Other: no, show me.
Andy: okay.
Other: dive in right here.
Andy: in a minute. in a minute.
Other: okay. you don't know what you're doing.
Andy: a minute would be cool.
Erin: hey, dwight snoot.
Dwight: what-
Erin: what you doing?
Dwight: i'm relaxing. scram. [pushes her]
Erin: ow.
Andy: hey, stanley. um, what happened to my pants?
Other: i moved them. pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
Andy: where... [finds pants, looks for ring]
Erin: come on, don't you want to play?
Dwight: oh really?
Erin: yeah.
Dwight: yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, erin screams]
Kevin: whoa.
Angela: dwight! oh my gosh! dwight!
Other: here we have the parlor. i imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. this was the gateway. you enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. susan used it as a pilates studio.
Oscar: [sees wine collection] holy cow!
Other: wine collection.
Oscar: how many bottles? three hundred?
Other: [laughs] about twelve hundred. what the hell, grab a bottle. less inventory for the lawyers.
Oscar: toby! chateau margaux ninety-five. you know your wine.
Toby: well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
Ryan: robert, you are too kind.
Other: oh.
Other: too kind doesn't begin to cover it.
Ryan: with ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
Other: and gabe-y makes three.
Jim: robert, thank you. thank you for this. thank you for all this. this night's been magical.
Other: jim, come see this next room. i think you especially would like it.
Jim: really? why?
Other: i don't know. maybe not. just come.
Erin: [dwight dunks her] oh!
Dwight: [laughs] you regret attacking me now, hick? huh?
Erin: stop it. dwight, i was flirting with you. i was trying to use you to make andy jealous.
Dwight: i'm not going to help you. why would you choose me? because i'm mighty? because i'm the manliest man in the office? i'll do it. [he picks her up]
Erin: [giggles] oh dwight!
Erin: [giggles] stop.
Dwight: you stop.
Erin: no, you stop.
Dwight: no, you stop.
Erin: [to camera] is he looking? [shakes her head] oh. you can stop.
Dwight: okay, you can stop.
Erin: no, no, no, he's not looking.
Dwight: no, you can stop.
Erin: you can actually stop.
Kelly: whoa, you guys, i just found this insane engagement ring. is anyone missing this?
Other: the main stone's missing.
Kelly: i don't know. it looks pretty great to me.
Other: i pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. then i met the vegan.
Jim: good night.
Oscar: [raises wine bottle] to the kitchen!
Other: to the kitchen!
Other: to the kitchen. onward!
Oscar: toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. right?
Toby: note? it's a symphony.
Oscar: okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Toby: i would love that.
Toby: toby, you are playing a dangerous game. guess i'm through the gateway now, though, right?
Darryl: [to val] you know, i don't think i've ever been in this exact angle before. i was scared at first, but i like it.
Other: you guys got to try this pool. no top scum, no band-aids. this thing is choice.
Other: you in?
Darryl: yeah, sure, sure. i'll be right in.
Darryl: i've been working out. but, the problem is, i've been building muscle underneath. and that top layer hasn't burned off yet. awkward stage.
Dwight: [he and erin feed each other chips] ah, mmm. so good. now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. do it. now rub it in. oh, yeah, that's so good. ah...
Erin: andy's not even looking. i think sexy eating is a dead end.
Dwight: damn it.
Erin: what is the most romantic possible thing?
Dwight: we can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Erin: dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. thank you.
Other: yes! [they high five and jump in the pool]
Angela: you're in my way!
Erin: andy, dwight and i challenge you and jess to a chicken fight. winner take all.
Dwight: chicken fight!
Andy: no thanks.
Erin: dang it! what the heck already?
Dwight: hey, cathy. chicken fight!
Other: okay, yeah. who's going to be my partner? where's jim?
Kevin: i'm right here! [gets in pool] cold. cold. come on, cath.
Dwight: yeah- oh!
Erin: [knocks cathy off kevin's shoulders] yes! woo!
Dwight: woohoo! yes!
Erin: dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. we work so well together.
Dwight: i know. i could just bang you right now.
Erin: he's not looking. [dwight dumps her in the pool] hey!
Other: i had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. total waste of two bears.
Jim: to both these bears.
Ryan: to both these bears.
Toby: bears.
Oscar: to both these bears.
Other: when i put in the screening room, i bought three movies: caligula, last tango in paris, and emmanuelle 2. last two movies i actually watched in here marley and me and on golden [bleep] pond.
Ryan: i mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
Other: yup. we could watch some right now if you want. i got a korean film on my ipod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
Andy: kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.
Kelly: yeah, thanks. i'm really glad i found it.
Andy: i can't believe you're wearing it. are you not superstitious at all?
Kelly: shh. of course i'm superstitious. what are you talking about?
Andy: the ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? am i just being silly?
Phyllis: oh, i don't think you're being silly.
Kelly: oh god. [takes off ring]
Andy: you know what, i can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
Phyllis: [snatches ring] then another woman will get it. we can't allow that. we have to destroy it.
Other: [to andy] come on. let's chicken fight those two.
Other: [comes up from under water] how was that?
Kevin: okay. watch my toes. [does hand stand]
Darryl: hey val. want a beer? it might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
Other: no, i'm good. thank you.
Darryl: cool.
Other: cool. [to kevin] does darryl not swim?
Kevin: that's racist! i don't know. but i would say, by looking at him, no, darryl does not swim.
Other: [knocks erin off dwight's shoulders] yes!
Andy: yeah!
Dwight: [to erin] maybe we should take a little break.
Erin: dwight, we've got this. i promise. i will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
Dwight: okay.
Erin: one more?
Andy: yeah!
Other: yeah! great! [others cheer and clap]
Erin: mush, mush, mush! come on!
Dwight: go!
Erin: go! okay. yeah.
Other: here we go! [knocks erin over] yes!
Andy: yay! [erin comes back up] whoa!
Kevin: wow!
Andy: i cannot believe you're still up!
Other: i cannot believe it either.
Erin: i've got this! [dwight gasps] charge! go! go! [dwight sinks]
Andy: [muffled] dwight are you okay? hey, damn it-
Dwight: [coughs up water] erin, did we win?
Erin: sure. sure we did.
Dwight: you're lying. we didn't win.
Erin: hey, hey, hey dwight. it's okay. just rest. just rest.
Kelly: you've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. do it. [meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]
Angela: we're in the pool!
Other: shut it, angela.
Dwight: ugh. same old party, same old people. am i right? reminds me of phyllis's birthday.
Andy: ooh, do not remind me of phyllis's birthday.
Dwight: i know. [laughs] but boy, that erin. she sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? rroww! and to think, i always thought of her as a second meredith. respectfully, i don't want us walking into a similar angela kind of situation.
Andy: mmm.
Dwight: so i just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with erin.
Andy: last i checked, i'm with jessica. and i like to get my monog on. it's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
Dwight: not what i asked.
Andy: we're done. erin and i are over.
Dwight: so then you won't mind if tonight i just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. with sex.
Andy: have at it. or take it slow. whatever you guys work out.
Dwight: [sighs] you're an idiot.
Kevin: kelly, that is mine! this is mine! [val, erin and kevin play with pool noodles]
Erin: uh-uh. uh-uh.
Kevin: no!
Other: oh i've got him!
Darryl: cannonball! [jumps in pool] let's do this!
Andy: [erin swims up with ring] wow.
Erin: so i kind of stepped on this. i think it's yours.
Andy: yeah. oh wow. how did you know it was mine?
Erin: the bernard family seal. duh.
Andy: duh.
Erin: sorry if your special night was ruined.
Andy: oh, whoa. whoa, no, it's not a special night.
Erin: oh, you weren't going to do that?
Andy: honestly erin, i don't know what i'm doing. i... i just... i don't know. thank you.
Erin: andy's confused. that's not what i was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. i can live with confused. i get confused. i totally get confused.
Other: and of course, the pool. the ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. it was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
Jim: to madness.
Ryan: to madness.
Toby: to madness. [robert laughs]
Other: to madness.
Jim: hey, um, i think you parked my car in. is there any way you can move your van?
Other: oh, i'm sorry. when i got here, i put my keys in a bowl.
Jim: are you serious?
Ryan: robert, i want you to know, i'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
Other: and that goes double for me. i'll stay even later than you'd like.
Oscar: [toby pours wine into oscar's mouth] toby! i am bacchus, god of wine!
Toby: and i am bacchus's friend!
Other: gentlemen, bear witness. while i've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. this is no get-together. this is a party. [robert strips, jumps in pool, gabe and ryan join him]
Other: yes! woohoo! bravo!
Jim: and there's my talking point.
Other: yes, that's it. push yourselves, boys. it's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. i need a breather. oh. oh. you two keep going.
Ryan: hey, he's asleep. we can just leave.
Other: so leave.
Ryan: two pools. a divider. a bridge. good choice. it says everything about everything, right robert?
Other: what's the water like?
Darryl: nice.
Angela: oh, it is warm.
Phyllis: robert's house is, well....i don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
Erin: oh, dwight.
Dwight: uh huh.
Erin: that feels so good!
Dwight: yeah....baby.
Erin: [grunting] hey, andy.
Andy: hey.
Erin: dwight gives the best back massages.
Andy: yeah, it sounds like it.
Dwight: hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
Erin: i don't know, why don't you check me dr. shrute. [laughing]
Dwight: no, seriously. your spine is jacked. it's like the devil's cursive.
Erin: you mean more like dangerous curves...
Dwight: you'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes erin back to floor]
Erin: ow!
Erin: you date a guy, you find out he was engaged to your coworker so you throw cake at him. it's over. you start liking him again so you ask him out with a puppet show. he says no. then he follows you home to make sure that you don't kiss somebody. then he ignores you at a pool party? am i right ladies?
Dwight: [erin helps dwight stretch his inner thighs] yeah. oh, yeah. oooooh, yeah.
Other: you guys ready?
Andy: bring it on guys.
Dwight: yeah...
Andy: let's go before i vomit. [erin and dwight enter pool]
Dwight: ready?
Erin: i'm ready.
Other: whoo!
Andy: alright! here we go.
Erin: ok.
Dwight: rahhh!!!!!!!
Other: yeah, come on!
Dwight: get her! ruin her! [andy and jessica beat dwight and erin]
Andy: hey! high-five!
Other: yeah!
Other: my brother and i were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. i mean, we beat the strauss twins. ok, i guess somebody didn't grow up in west hartford, connecticut.
Other: this room i liked for the view. i dreamed that i would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before. [laughs]
Ryan: i get that.
Other: beautiful sentiment.
Jim: to the shame room! [raises bottle]
Other: [robert laughs] i live in this room.
Oscar: [toby and oscar swig from wine bottles] oh, mineral-ey.
Toby: mineral-ey.
Andy: val, i need the space.
Other: all right guys, clear out.
Andy: everybody out.
Other: promise me you're going to clean up.
Andy: i can't promise what i'm going to do or not do.
Other: promise me that-
Andy: obviously i'm going to clean up.
Andy: stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'oh yeah, mayor stress? well watch this!' and then... we dance. oh how we dance. [dances to kenny loggin's footloose] sex also works.
Erin: hey! jim's back from jury duty.
Andy: hey! tuna! he's back.
Jim: hey.
Andy: oh, look at this. [hugs jim] tuna wrap.
Jim: okay.
Andy: [grabs jim's wrist] hand roll.
Jim: yeah.
Phyllis: how was jury duty?
Jim: it was pretty uneventful, actually.
Dwight: can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. makes me question the whole judicial system.
Erin: what was the case?
Jim: uh, hit and run.
Erin: ooh, 'the case of the hit and run,' that's exciting.
Phyllis: did you send him to the slammer?
Jim: nope. not guilty.
Dwight: of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'oh, he apologized and i just really want him to like me, mm.'
Jim: we're best friends, actually. we're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Dwight: not coming, have plans.
Jim: okay.
Jim: i did get called in to jury duty. and they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. and then the next morning pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so i took an extra day to help out. and then three other days happened.
Erin: ah! angela had the baby!
Kevin: is it black? 'cause that would be hilarious.
Darryl: why?
Kevin: you know.
Darryl: would it be more hilarious than angela having a chinese baby?
Kevin: a little bit, yeah. right guys? back me up.
Ryan: eh, a little bit.
Kevin: oh, did i win the pool?
Erin: ah, no. right month, wrong year.
Oscar: well no one won the pool. angela wasn't due for another month.
Erin: we should all go to the hospital and visit her.
Phyllis: oh, i'd love to but, um-
Jim: aw man, i would but i can't miss any more work.
Oscar: well kevin and i have to go, accounting is its own little family.
Kevin: yeah, oscar's the dad, i'm oscar's dad and angela's my mom.
Other: everyone, our very own angela-
Oscar: we all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
Other: oh, i am so in.
Other: i love maternity wards. it's the perfect blend of love and horror. things can go so wrong or so right.
Andy: come on, judge judy, tell us your case. what were the deets?
Jim: mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Other: how could it be boring? you were there for five days. titillate us.
Other: yeah, you owe us. i had to stay until six twice to cover for you. my wife got to the tv first, had to sit through damn rizzoli and damn isles.
Phyllis: yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and i had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Jim: wow, i'm really sorry.
Phyllis: yeah.
Jim: i never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. the least i could do is give them a good story.
Jim: [demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] so phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
Toby: you know, when i was on j-duty, uh, strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at ernesto's.
Jim: oh man, ernesto's. that was our favorite restaurant too.
Toby: you mean food truck. ernesto's was a food truck.
Other: toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. nobody cares about the empanadas.
Dwight: i was in los angeles last year. jim tricked me into thinking i'd won a walk-on part on ncis, but that's not important. while i was being kicked off the lot, i saw food trucks everywhere. everyone in los angeles eats from them. and nobody calls them restaurants.
Oscar: [whispering] guys, i don't know how many of you have seen- gabe? bring it in. i don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. it's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Kevin: got that, bimbo?
Erin: got it, bimbo. [oscar knocks at the door]
Angela: yes?
Oscar: knock, knock. oh!
Kevin: hi!
Angela: oh... i don't- i don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
Oscar: we wanted to say hi to the newest little dunder mifflinite.
Other: well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, philip halsted lipton.
Kevin: phillip is so fat.
Oscar: kevin!
Kevin: you warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, oscar. but you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
Angela: hey.
Other: yes, he's substantial.
Erin: he's more than substantial. he's a monster.
Dwight: so this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part i can't figure out. you said it was at a four-way stop...
Jim: mm-hmm.
Dwight: and the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Jim: mm-hmm.
Dwight: see, that's what i'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] busted, halpert!
Jim: okay, wait, wait.
Dwight: yes! andy, get out here.
Jim: no. i never said he was on a bicycle. i just said i wasn't listening to you.
Dwight: i am making a citizen's arrest. you have the right to remain silent. you have the right to beg for mercy. you have the right to request judgment by combat. dwight's rights.
Andy: what's up, gangstas?
Dwight: jim was lying about jury duty. he was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. i don't know what this pervert likes. fire him!
Andy: dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
Dwight: i have jim on the record saying that the vic-
Andy: no. dwight! i have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
Dwight: i don't- i don't need to take a chill pill.
Andy: here, right there. [mimes giving dwight a pill and a glass] down the hatch.
Dwight: i really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
Andy: attaboy. good. now, chill.
Dwight: okay, okay. [sits, exhales] but let's just say that jim was lying about jury duty. you would have to fire him, right?
Andy: yeah, sure, of course. i'd fire him to timbuktu. [jim laughs nervously]
Dwight: that's good enough for me. [exhales again]
Jim: ...and pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of philip because cece has been out of control recently, and- look, andy, it doesn't matter. the truth is, i just feel terrible lying to you.
Andy: i feel terrible getting lied to. no one's ever lied to me before.
Jim: okay. i think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Andy: no, not after what i told dwight about firing you. no. here's what we're going to do. we're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. have you ever heard of a connecticut cover-up?
Jim: no.
Andy: do you know why you never heard of it?
Jim: no.
Andy: covered it up.
Jim: are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Andy: they used to call me king tut because i'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
Andy: my nickname was actually king butt, because i had a king-size butt.
Other: [pulls food truck up to where dwight and nate are standing] where you want i park?
Dwight: okay, everybody, gather 'round. got a real special surprise for you. [indicates ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
Toby: ernesto!
Other: hola toby! [mimes choking]
Toby: yeah, hey.
Other: como esta? [speaks spanish]
Other: uh, i'm going to say 'i' when i'm talking for ernesto, so instead of 'he says blah, blah, blah,' i'm going to say 'i say, blah, blah, blah,' but that's for him. anyway, it was something like, 'he remembers toby.' [makes face] 'i remember toby.'
Dwight: okay- oh, jim. hey, this guy look familiar?
Jim: uh-
Toby: it's the empanada guy.
Jim: the empanada guy!
Dwight: no, toby! [bleep] damn it, toby! no, i wasn't asking you. [sighs] ask him if he remembers jim. [nate asks ernesto a question in spanish]
Other: no.
Other: he says, 'no.'
Dwight: he says, 'no!' boom!
Andy: yeah but who remembers all their customers? i mean, i can name like three of our clients.
Dwight: okay, he remembers toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [ernesto says something in spanish]
Other: ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
Jim: uh, you guys are going to love these. so, empanadas on me. you guys gotta try them.
Other: usually i'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, i won't. wink, wink.
Dwight: great. and while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Andy: why? everybody's heard it.
Dwight: walk us through it. what time would you get there every morning?
Andy: hey, murder she wrote. how about we drop the whole 'murder, she wrote' thing, okay? jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. how do i know? because i drove him there.
Phyllis: why?
Andy: why? why? [looks at jim]
Jim: because my car broke down.
Andy: his car broke down. so he called me, 'cause i live near the courthouse.
Dwight: wait, wait. you live by the courthouse. so you drove from near the courthouse, out to jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Andy: thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. and i would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
Phyllis: [to ernesto] i'm sorry, do you have any american mexican food?
Andy: we're getting buried out there. what was that stuff about the car breaking down?
Jim: well, i think you handled it pretty well.
Andy: i'm not rumpelstiltskin, jim. i can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].
Jim: okay, listen, all right? dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Andy: [sighs] i don't even know what the truth is anymore.
Oscar: wow, it's so... healthy.
Kevin: i'm going to call him little kevin.
Angela: no, you will not.
Erin: is he really five pounds?
Angela: mm-hmm.
Erin: because i squat with five pounds. this- [squats, grunts] yeah, this feels like more than that.
Other: no, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces.
Angela: nine pounds? really? i thought you said five. you know what? i was under so many drugs, i felt like i was at a james taylor concert or something, oh. so, what did you bring?
Oscar: oh yeah, i don't know if it's right, but-
Other: well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park.
Angela: aw, preemie pajamas!
Oscar: again, it may not be the right size. i can return-
Angela: no, i think he came early just so he could wear these. thank you.
Kevin: i got little kevin call of duty.
Oscar: this baby is clearly not premature. they're lying about the date it was conceived. it's very interesting. and her husband's gay. i don't even know which thread to follow.
Jim: uh, excuse me, can i have everyone's attention for a second? first off, i just want to say that i'm really sorry, i didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though i did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on monday. and i think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. i kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
Other: what?
Jim: funny? no? nobody laughing?
Dwight: [laughs] you're screwed! oh, it's happening. it's really happening.
Other: what the hell, jim? i covered for your bony butt.
Jim: pam really needed some help with the kids, so, i promise my intentions were good.
Dwight: your clients. they're all mine.
Darryl: jim, i got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. and andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
Andy: uh, i did, every morning. and if i didn't, then i hope i die.
Dwight: all right, well. let's get this show on the road, shall we? allow me to give you a hand. [puts jim's things in a box] here we are. so long, clump-mate. i'm going to miss you. truth be told, i never thought that this was how it was going to end. i always thought that i was going to defeat you somehow. but you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
Andy: dwight, cut it out. i'm not firing jim.
Dwight: no, no, no. you said- you said that you were-
Andy: i know what i said. jim, you're in deep doo-doo. do you understand? i have one thing to say to you, and i'm going to say it in front of this whole office. look me in the eye. [gives jim a limp slap]
Dwight: that's it? this is crap! [dumps the box on jim's desk and leaves]
Other: [on voicemail] you've reached gabe lewis, i'm currently indisposed. leave me a message. ciao. [beep]
Dwight: gabe, it's dwight again. highest priority, triple-urgent. call me. immediately. that means asap.
Dwight: i'm gonna find gabe, tell him what jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
Angela: shh.
Oscar: honestly, i can return this for a larger size.
Angela: it's fine. pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? it's not the barrio.
Oscar: the only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Angela: ah!
Kevin: [giggles] little kevin.
Angela: really?
Oscar: angela.
Angela: fine, god. philip was conceived nine months ago.
Oscar: i knew that, i knew it.
Angela: the senator and i wanted to wait, but we had just seen thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
Oscar: chicken marsala.
Angela: right. um, point is, philip was conceived out of wedlock.
Oscar: mm-hmm.
Angela: and now you all know, but you can never tell. i'm serious.
Oscar: dwight. hey.
Dwight: oh, hey. have you seen gabe?
Oscar: he went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
Dwight: okay. [sits]
Oscar: don't you want to see the baby?
Dwight: psh! why? i know what angela and the senator look like. i can mash that up in my head right now.
Oscar: i promised i wouldn't tell.
Dwight: so don't.
Oscar: angela got pregnant before the wedding.
Dwight: what?
Oscar: she got pregnant before the wedding.
Dwight: how long before?
Oscar: a month. [dwight leaves, oscar calls after him] you didn't hear it from me!
Dwight: yes i did.
Angela: dwight?
Other: dwight.
Dwight: i want to see the baby.
Erin: oh, angela will make you cut your fingernails. it's not worth it.
Dwight: oh, yes. oh, what a beautiful child. prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. you will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
Dwight: that baby is a schrute. and unless somebody taught mose sex, that baby is mine.
Angela: he's hungry.
Other: oh, that's my cue to leave.
Angela: no, you don't have to. i'm going to wear this cover.
Other: still. still.
Angela: you won't see-
Jim: [to cece] you want a giraffe?
Jim: yes, i am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. and you all remember my beautiful wife, pam.
Pam: hi. wow, i really thought i'd be more excited to be here.
Jim: whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
Pam: oh right, okay. hey stanley, it's great to see you!
Jim: whoa, no, no. that's overdoing it, i think.
Pam: oh, hi stanley.
Jim: split the difference?
Pam: jim.
Jim: okay, let's go.
Pam: hey.
Erin: hi.
Pam: hi everybody!
Jim: what?
Other: hi.
Pam: how about a little visit?
Jim: wow, what a surprise. that's crazy. you guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
Other: hey, angela's back with her baby.
Pam: yes, well, you guys all know cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby philip.
Andy: aw! you guys. he's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
Other: let me have a turn.
Pam: no, it's the pacifier's turn.
Other: all right.
Jim: did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Pam: [gasps] yes! cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
Phyllis: cookies?
Pam: no, but that would've been a really good idea.
Jim: that was a great idea.
Pam: no, she brought you drawings.
Jim: oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. they're usually amazing, so let's see. yup, they are. uncle andy.
Andy: oh!
Jim: oh, aunt phyllis.
Phyllis: oh.
Andy: wow, these are incredible. cece, did you do these?
Other: no.
Pam: she says 'no' to everything. you know, she thinks my name is 'no.' cece, do you want some broccoli?
Other: yes.
Pam: no. it's crazy.
Ryan: why am i shorter than the table that i'm standing next to?
Andy: there's cross-hatching in some of these. that's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
Kelly: cece, this is your big sister kelly. did you color this pretty picture?
Other: no.
Kelly: so then this means nothing to you. [rips picture]
Andy: hey, cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
Jim: you know what? i don't think you need to do things on command. that's very weird. i'll just take that. thank you. i think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. right?
Other: [cries] mama!
Pam: shh.
Jim: i don't know what else we can do here.
Other: [cries] mama, mama, mama.
Jim: it's okay.
Pam: oh, it's okay, sweetie.
Jim: all right, all right. okay.
Pam: it's okay, honey. [philip cries] it's okay, it's okay.
Jim: all right, i know, i know. let's just get this.
Pam: shh.
Other: mama!
Dwight: angela, this child is definitely mine. he looks just like me.
Angela: every baby looks just like you. your face kind of looks like a baby.
Dwight: need i remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Angela: that is completely untrue.
Dwight: completely true. remember? angela. no.
Dwight: you said that robert was not fulfilling you-
Angela: i did not. uh-uh.
Dwight: -and i said, 'i bet i could fulfill you,' and you said, 'i'd like to see you try,' and then i kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
Angela: that didn't happen.
Dwight: and then i inserted my penis-
Angela: no! stop it!
Dwight: into your-
Angela: dwight.
Dwight: vagina and-
Angela: and even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
Dwight: admit that there is a chance.
Angela: i will not.
Dwight: admit it. admit it.
Angela: i will not, it's not-
Other: all done?
Dwight: yeah.
Other: mmm.
Angela: yes, yes. he's sleeping.
Dwight: before i go, may i?
Angela: sure. [gives philip to dwight] watch the head, watch the head.
Dwight: nurse, you know that baby in there, baby philip? cancel the circumcision.
Other: who are you?
Dwight: i just might be his father.
Other: i don't know what that means. we're gonna circumcise him.
Jim: [philip is crying] i know, buddy, i know. cece, you want to come? want to come out?
Other: no!
Jim: oh bud, i know. do you have a pacifier or anything?
Pam: i'm looking, i'm looking for the pacifier.
Jim: cece!
Pam: okay, we're going.
Jim: okay, okay, we gotta go. all right, we're going home, we're going home. we're going home, we're going home. i know, i know, bud.
Pam: shh, shh, shh.
Jim: i know, i know.
Pam: you want to grab her?
Jim: i'm gonna grab her, okay.
Pam: here we go, here we go.
Jim: hi, all right. i'm just going to go down to the car and i'm going to put her in her seat and i'll be right back up.
Other: [groans] we'll see you tomorrow.
Jim: no, no, it's okay, i'll be right back.
Phyllis: no, just go home.
Darryl: it's all good, we got this.
Darryl: i have a kid. last week, jim at home? that was no vacation.
Pam: jim.
Phyllis: just go.
Andy: hey, we'll be just fine.
Jim: thanks guys. all right, here we go. let's go.
Andy: oh, whew!
Andy: dwight, what the hell? you can't smoke in here.
Dwight: oh, right. [sighs] the office looks different now. huh. smaller. maybe i just feel bigger. hello gabe.
Other: you had something important to tell me?
Dwight: oh, you know, i did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Dwight: jim? oh, right. nah, forget it. he was doing it for his kids. i get it. kids drive us dads crazy. sometimes i feel like they're raising us. am i right?
Jim: i would love for everyone to just forgive me. but, if that's not happening, i'm not averse to just buying them all off.
Jim: alright guys. you know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] bought it all. now it's like red city in there. so, enjoy it.
Phyllis: mmm-hmm. moneybags. must be nice.
Andy: so you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?
Jim: uh, i can't get a handle on it. am i cheap or rich? i can't...
Andy: you're nothing. when i think about all the gas money i spent on you. washing my car to make sure you-
Jim: [interrupting] alright. well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]
Darryl: whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! so you're just gonna throw away perfectly good food?
Jim: it's not really food, right?
Other: i'm really hating this jim guy!
Jim: ok, ok, ok.
Other: i know what you can do jim. take those black licorice, then go get some of those red licorice, take 'em in your hand, roll 'em up real tight...
Jim: ???and shove it up my butt.???
Other: dammit jim! you stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! it's not ???shove it up your butt??? it's....i'll kill you! i'll kill you dead!
Darryl: eat it.
Jim: i'm not gonna eat it.
Darryl: eat. it.
Jim: i'm not-
Other: eat it! [jim begins eating black licorice]
Jim: [on phone] they hate me, pam.
Pam: they don't hate you.
Jim: no, it's bad. darryl canceled go-karting....
Pam: when were you going go-karting with darryl?
Jim: it's a lunch thing.
Pam: alright. just don't worry, we'll figure this out.
Jim: i feel like a stranger in my own country.
Pam: ok, drama.
Jim: ok. well, hey, you're not here. you don't know, ok? it's intense. they made me eat black licorice.
Dwight: i have a recurring nightmare that i've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. stanley is fast asleep, kevin eats the evidence, phyllis's name is allison but it really is phyllis, jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. the cop takes me away and tells me that i've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. she leaves the handcuffs on. they take me away to prison. the guards are all women. [sighs]
Andy: everyone, this is officer foley from the scranton pd. works down at the courthouse. i think he has something he's like to say.
Other: i understand that some of you don't believe that mr. bernard drove his friend into the courthouse for jury duty last week.
Darryl: correction: we don't care.
Erin: hey, aren't you an actor?
Andy: no.
Erin: weren't you in sweeny todd last year with andy?
Other: uh, no.
Darryl: you hired your actor friend to come here as a cop?
Andy: that is so offensive and ridiculous. i-
Darryl: so if i started singing ???down by the old mill stream???, you couldn't join me in a three part harmony. [andy and officer foley shake their heads no, darryl begins singing] down by the, down by the, down by the....
Other: [singing] old mill stream. when i first met you, down by the old mill stream [andy & foley hold ???stream???]
Darryl: [low singing] old, mill, stream.
Andy: ho hah!....oh, shoot.
Darryl: mm hmm.
Jim: oh ho! look who's back reporting for duty.
Pam: hey guys!
Other: hey.
Pam: [laughing] hi.
Andy: pam! ahh! look what i can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch pam in the stomach] bam! bam! bam! bam!
Phyllis: are you glad to be back?
Pam: yeah. yeah, i mean i could have used another week, or three.
Other: you still had eight weeks more than we did.
Pam: [laughing] well, it's not exactly a vacation.
Angela: hello everyone! remember little old me. hi!
Dwight: what are you doing here? you just had our baby. our collective dunder mifflin...family baby. four days ago.
Angela: i wanted to come back to work. not everybody needs some long luxurious parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Pam: what?!
Kelly: damn girl! your body!
Oscar: angela, you look amazing.
Angela: really? i feel like this big rhinoceros. anyway, i wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so i made some treats. i've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
Other: [murmurs of delight as people shuffle toward the treats]
Pam: oh angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and i think kevin's allergic to walnuts. you're allergic to walnuts, right kevin?
Kevin: extremely, but i'm gonna fight through it.
Pam: aw. it's ok angela. i have mommy brain too.
Angela: i don't know what that is, pam. i made a batch with no nuts, special for you kevin, right here.
Pam: when did you find time to do all this?
Angela: babies sleep a lot pam, if you feed them enough. brownie pam?
Pam: thank you. [takes bite] oh my gosh. it's really good.
Angela: i wouldn't know, i'm watching my weight. ugh.
Pam: so you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. so-
Jim: nope. it's over.
Pam: ...we wanted to say thank you-
Jim: nope. ok.
Andy: dwight, i have exciting news for you.
Dwight: what?
Andy: i think you're going to like it.
Dwight: you can't tantalize me.
Andy: oooh, maybe i can. [slowly] i got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
Dwight: ok. [looks at watch and leaves]
Andy: that...[quickly] you got a promotion! [dwight turns back] right? i mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
Dwight: if you make me head of sales one more time, i swear.
Andy: no, this is legit. you will be assembling a team to go to tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of sabre stores.
Dwight: yes! yes! yes! yes! yes! yes! yes! yes! yes! yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Dwight: the shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: perfectinschlag. hmm. right now, i am in it. i finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, i am assembling a competent team, i am likely a father, i am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. and just to be clear, there is a second definition, ???perfect pork anus??? which i don't mean.
Erin: and here's the fax for you.
Andy: and here's some facts for you. did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? and that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
Erin: ah! love to learn.
Andy: yeah, it's weird that i said that last one.
Erin: so... [points out their matching heart pins]
Andy: uh yeah, look at that.
Erin: we're pin twins.
Andy: pin twins! this is a gift from jessica, kind of a gag gift really. real gifts come later.
Erin: yeah. that's cute. when i saw it in cvs it made me gag too. [andy laughs, walks away, erin throws away her pin]
Erin: for a while there i thought something would change. but nope. andy's still with jessica, they even carpool together most days. i don't know, i wouldn't mind carpooling every day with andy, but i wouldn't want to spend that much time with jessica.
Darryl: what do we have here?
Darryl: val knit me a beanie. but i can't if it's a ???we're just friends??? beanie or a ???i'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'??? beanie. so i'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
Dwight: pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in tallahassee, florida where i'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
Pam: really?
Dwight: mm hm.
Pam: i'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
Jim: ooh, me three.
Dwight: eh! no plus one's. this is for competent workers only. and don't worry about the cost, sabre is footing the bill.
Pam: does this have anything to do with what you were talking to andy about?
Dwight: god, you're such a spy.
Darryl: [clears throat] notice anything different about me?
Other: you're wearing the beanie. you like it?
Darryl: super comfortable. like sweatpants for my head.
Other: i love it too val. it's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so i can't really peg it on the hat.
Darryl: [noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] wow. it's like the nation of islam down here.
Other: i like to knit, don't hate. and who's that for?
Darryl: oh, this is a gift, for....my man nate here.
Other: what?
Darryl: yeah.
Other: darryl, you shouldn't have.
Darryl: hey.
Other: can i open it?
Darryl: no, no, no. maybe just later.
Other: ah, i can't wait. i'm sorry. i get too excited. [opens gift] darryl.
Other: wow. those are really nice.
Other: they're so elegant.
Other: cashmere.
Other: how'd you know?
Darryl: just a hunch. your gift is on the way.
Other: can't wait.
Other: [reading card] ???i'm glad you're in my life. happy valentine's day.??? ugh, darryl. i am glad to be in your life too. oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
Dwight: my first task as special project manager dwight shrute? assembling a crack team. i need people who are loyal. people who'll help me get an inroad with the gay hispanic community. people who won't be missed. we don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... what's your name?
Other: kathy.
Dwight: kathy.
Jim: i just got a text from robert california that says ???bring your clubs to florida???.
Pam: why? does he think you're going to florida?
Jim: i hope not. [laughs] because i am not going. two question marks?
Pam: no, just do one. two question marks is kind of aggressive. you know it's like wha-what?? just do one.
Andy: you wanna take darryl, phyllis, toby, angela and oscar?
Dwight: yes.
Andy: can i interest you in someone less essential? like uh a creed or a meredith perhaps?
Dwight: oh my god.
Andy: they're not expendable exactly, i just can't...i can't think of the word i'm trying to find.
Dwight: are you kidding me?! i'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? we'd never get off the runway.
Andy: alright, look. i gotta keep this office functioning somehow. so, i have put together a list, here's your team. darryl and phyllis you can have, but you're also taking kathy, kelly and kevin.
Dwight: oh god.
Andy: you have your team.
Dwight: kevin!? kelly!? kathy!? andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? i have. and now i no longer own an arctic wolf.
Pam: well, let's hear it.
Jim: ???robert, hey!??? exclamation point.
Pam: i like it so far.
Jim: ???got your text, awesome idea. let's hit the links next time you're in pa??? dash jh.
Pam: it's perfect. you emphasized the golf, completely omit the florida.
Jim: yeah, it's a golf text.
Pam: total golf text. send it.
Jim: duh- wait. i just feel weird. i should just call him.
Kelly: you wanna call someone? that texted you!? do you wanna drive them away? i mean, ugh.
Darryl: [on phone] this is darryl.
Other: oh, sorry i asked for the main shipping number. i just need the address for the warehouse? i want to send my girlfriend some flowers.
Darryl: your girlfriend? is your girlfriend val?
Other: yeah, do you know her?
Darryl: we're friends. we're friends.
Other: cool. um, so can i get that address or...?
Darryl: yeah sorry, i'm just looking for a pen.
Other: why do you need a pen?
Darryl: back off! i got my reasons.
Dwight: may i have your attention please? could kathy, darryl, phyllis, kevin and kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Kelly: why?
Dwight: oh, no big deal. it's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to tallahassee, florida.
Kelly: hell yeah.
Other: what?!
Dwight: oh, i'm sorry stanley, i can't share any more details with you. you see, andy rejected you.
Other: wait. kathy gets to go? uh, why does she even still work here? pam is back.
Oscar: it just feels like a slap in the face.
Dwight: i can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. i'm sure he had his reasons.
Oscar: we're not questioning his reasons. i just wanna know what they are.
Dwight: i know, you and me both, brother. it seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Kevin: well, he nailed it because i do deserve a vacation. sometimes batman's gotta take off his cape.
Dwight: good point. but we're gonna be working pretty hard until five pm. after that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to cape canaveral, and sea kayaking with gloria estefan.
Ryan: what are the criteria for going?
Dwight: it might be innate goodness versus innate badness? but there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on andy's office door] oh andy, gotta few questions for you.
Andy: mooshie mooshie. [dwight laughs]
Dwight: uh, the florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
Andy: well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...i feel like we should respect that.
Other: respect it? you're trying to tell me kevin malone deserves more than stanley hudson.
Kevin: hey!
Angela: ok, it's obvious andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
Kelly: important? oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
Angela: my baby is not a monster!
Dwight: hey. be proud of your enormous monster baby. i was once an enormous monster baby.
Andy: guys. guys. guys. come on, seriously? we cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
Ryan: stop calling us ???guys???.
Andy: i use the word ???guys??? a lot when i'm nervous...guys.
Andy: guys! guys! guys!
Other: stop it!
Andy: guys..
Ryan: stop. stop it andy.
Oscar: ...andy.
Andy: dudes...the dudes who are going to florida were picked by dwight and me.
Dwight: ok hey. i specifically remember there were a lot of other people i thought should be considered.
Andy: wha-
Other: if anybody's going to florida, it should be me. every shirt i have that isn't a work shirt is a tommy bahama. i'm the only person in this office who watches burn notice.
Andy: ok, i did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to florida, i'm happy to hear you out.
Dwight: great idea! so why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to florida and andy and i will listen to it.
Andy: no. that is a ridiculous waste of time.
Kelly: for you maybe.
Andy: five to six hours?
Dwight: three to four hours.
Andy: no no no no.
Dwight: two to three hours...
Andy: nope.
Dwight: come up with a statement in the next hour....
Andy: thirty minutes!
Other: i'm out.
Pam: ok, read it back to me.
Jim: [reading text] robert, great offer. wish i could hit the links with you in florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Pam: good. doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
Erin: absolutely. works for me.
Jim: ok, sending.
Pam: well done. and we managed to kill the entire morning.
Jim: really did [text bleep] he responded l-o-l.
Erin: [laughs exaggeratedly]
Phyllis: i have a new swimsuit i need to break in....
Other: i am...
Dwight: i have already picked my team: darryl, oscar, angela, phyllis and toby and that is the team that i am taking. what's that? it's not up to me? i only have influence? well, that's all baltzer gladfielder had and no one eats owls for thanksgiving.
Ryan: you have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. that's myself and kelly kapoor, you need one of us there.
Andy: or both?
Ryan: not both. just one, me. or if not me, kelly. ideally me. again, youth knowledge. that's what you get when you put ryan howard on your special project team...or kelly kapoor. again, not both. thanks.
Andy: very impressive. he put a lot of work into that.
Dwight: mm-hm. powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. all show, no meat.
Kevin: because i feel like that i'm in a place with my gambling rehab that i can finally start going to dog racing again. you know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
Dwight: ok. thank you kevin, we'll let you know.
Andy: thank you.
Kevin: when do we leave?
Andy: thank you.
Toby: it has been a long, lonely winter.
Dwight: wow. seasonal effective disorder, aka: sad. that sounds like a very real thing, toby.
Toby: it is real, thank you for saying that.
Andy: yeah, wow. it's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
Other: florida stanley smiles. florida stanley is happy to go to work. florida stanley is who you want on your florida team.
Dwight: maybe it's what she does here...
Andy: well...
Erin: hey guys, any spots left?
Andy: erin, you wanna go to tallahassee?
Erin: i do. i really do. i think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Dwight: you know i don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. i think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Erin: either or. but if you can find someone to fill in, i would love to go.
Andy: well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
Erin: really? oh, great. good, ahem, good.
Jim: now, is it too dark to say that cici's having an operation?
Pam: i think you need to go to florida.
Jim: i think you're right.
Pam: it's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
Jim: total nightmare.
Pam: i was going to say good because i'll have all the help i need?
Jim: yeah, that's what i'm saying. they're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. i mean with them there, you probably won't even know i'm gone.
Pam: exactly.
Dwight: well, [jim enters] no! no! absolutely not! you are not going. over my dead body, no. andy?
Andy: tuns, i'm really sorry. you're too essential to the operation here, i can't let you go.
Dwight: i wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Jim: you know dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell andy that i actually am essential to the operation. that way i couldn't go.
Dwight: jim is essential to th-
Jim: hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
Dwight: andy, jim is just too...essen-...
Jim: essential.
Dwight: this is stupid! cut.
Jim: alright, i'm gonna pack my trunks.
Dwight: he doesn't even want to go.
Jim: well, i got a text from rc inviting me to come down so i think that's gonna make us roomates.
Dwight: oh my god.
Jim: hey, quick question: do you shower at night or in the morning? cause i wanna shower when you're showering. save some water.
Andy: ok, listen up everyone, here's who's going to florida: kathy..
Dwight: what?
Andy: ???.stanley..
Dwight: no.
Andy: ...ryan...
Dwight: no!
Andy: ...erin...
Dwight: (bleep)
Andy: ...and, jim.
Dwight: you've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. ok. ok, florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
Dwight: let's go, step it up you runts. you infants, let's move.
Other: why is it so hot in here?
Dwight: hot? what are you talking about? this is a nice temperate florida morning. eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. this is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. welcome to special projects orientation. the next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. they're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. you're gonna wish you were dead.
Ryan: but...
Dwight: but? there's not buts. that's it. you'll wish you were dead. you seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Ryan: no no, i want to go.
Dwight: cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up taboo buzzer]
Jim: is that the buzzer from taboo?
Dwight: shut up maggot! you don't want to go, ring the bell! ring it! ring it.
Dwight: how many of you have seen the documentary deliverance?
Other: how did a mosquito get in here?
Dwight: i released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. when i'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [frog in plastic cage ribbits]
Dwight: yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ???i'm gonna make you the seventh mrs. rosenblatt??? unless you ring this bell. ring it! ring the bell. you wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? huh? do you? ring it! wha-, [jim slaps dwight's forehead] oh. what was that?
Jim: mosquito.
Dwight: [sighs and grunts] orientation is over.
Other: oh darryl, hey.
Darryl: hey what's up? you called?
Other: yeah, you know i, i felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and i didn't get you anything...
Darryl: it's cool really.
Other: no, it's anything but cool. now i haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [hands darryl pink slips of paper]
Darryl: ???this coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack???
Other: yeah, they're nate coupons. or nate-pons. and they're all different. cash that one in and i will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. i'll find you.
Darryl: thanks. [to val] nice flowers.
Other: thanks, they're from my mom.
Darryl: your mom?
Other: yeah.
Darryl: uh. so i guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? real deep voiced woman?
Other: yeah, that's her.
Darryl: she said her name was brandon, i think. your mom's name is brandon?
Other: [laughs] yeah darryl, my mom's name is brandon.
Darryl: then i guess i figured out where i stand. this is a love beanie.
Dwight: ok, florida team, let's reconvene.
Erin: i'm going to florida.....and i'm not coming back.
Dwight: so sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Jim: so, what is this special project?
Dwight: basically sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. they want to set up their own version of an apple store.
Jim: that sounds awesome.
Dwight: it did, it did.
Ryan: you know what might be great? is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
Erin: yeah. and they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. like a coat check. [dwight writes on whiteboard] oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
Dwight: oh, i like it.
Ryan: it seems to me that the apple store is kind of like a party. so i think our question is: how do we make this a better party?
Dwight: no. we sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. they need to be all business. let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Ryan: right. think different, from apple.
Jim: dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
Dwight: [long pause] yes. what are my expectations for the group?
Dwight: i have been given the responsibility to manage stanley, a solid player, ryan, who is capable of surprises, erin, an excellent follower and kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. and, well, jim. under the right manager, that's not a bad team. perfectinschlag.
Kelly: i don't know how i'm going to live here without you.
Ryan: me neither. hey, will you put this coat on my chair? i just realized i'm not going to need it down there.
Kelly: yes, i will take your coat. and i will keep it with me, and i will sleep with it because it smells like you.
Ryan: no, no, no, no. just put it on my chair.
Pam: alright [kiss]
Jim: bye.
Pam: bye. call me when you land.
Jim: i will.
Andy: safe travels.
Erin: goodbye for a very very long time.
Andy: oh, k. it's only three weeks.
Other: [on phone] all expenses paid. yeah, jim's gonna be there. their marriage is not good. nobody knows better than me. definitely we will. it's three weeks in tallahassee, what else is there to do?
Dwight: today is the first day of sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. i am meeting my new boss, nellie bertram, head of special projects. work starts at nine. sabre hq is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for ryan to do his morning ecstasy... we're already twenty minutes late.
Dwight: wake up! [cathy screams]
Dwight: hey, hey, hey, hey! wake up! [erin kicks him] ow! why are you sleeping that way?
Erin: oh. i was reading the mattress tag and i fell asleep.
Dwight: stanley! wake up! you???ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
Erin: stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [dwight pinches stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
Other: mmm! [struggles] ugh!
Dwight: [lets go] good morning.
Erin: hey, wake up. let's have some fun. we're in florida now.
Ryan: hey, you. i'm so glad this is happening. i actually came to your door twice last night. come on in, the water's fine. [sees dwight] oh, not cool!
Jim: i am on the two kid sleep schedule so i'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so i honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then i thought of something. uh- [hears door, hides]
Dwight: heeeere's dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] oh man.
Erin: what do you think happened?
Dwight: looks like jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'it was dwight' written in lipstick on the door] oh no, no, no, no. it wasn't me. i gotta find luwanda at the alcohol club. oh. [jim falls out of the closet, erin and dwight scream]
Jim: puppet.
Other: cool, for your kids?
Jim: yeah. it's weird being away from them. never done this before.
Dwight: attention, dunder mifflin group. proceed outside. the vehicle is waiting. seats have been assigned. shotgun goes to ryan. congratulations, ryan.
Dwight: i need to make nellie see me as a leader today. first impressions get locked in forever. when i first met pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. since then i've loved working with pam and she's frankly wonderful, but i hate her.
Dwight: i'll have a bottle of the antacid. also, i want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. do you have anything for that? also, i want it to have a florida feel.
Other: what does he like?
Dwight: power.
Ryan: okay, and this one is, 'huh. don't see too many museums around here.'
Dwight: okay, twiggy, that's enough. get in the car.
Erin: hey, are you okay?
Dwight: i'm fine, okay? it's just stress. you know, 'cause i care about this project. and frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now i find very alarming.
Erin: who says none of us are diarrheal?
Jim: are you sure it's stress? because i did poison you.
Dwight: very funny, jim.
Jim: oh no, i'm serious. i was thinking, 'for this trip i have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then i thought of it. i'll poison you. what are you gonna do? you gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Dwight: i'm gonna set your face on fire.
Jim: that's a good one. [a red sports car drives up] whoa, stanley! did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Other: laugh it up, halpert. i'm in florida for a month without my family. i'm gonna enjoy this. want to get in? you can work the ipod.
Jim: yes.
Other: you're a nice guy, jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. find some kenny loggins.
Jim: loggins and messina.
Other: did i say 'messina?' [tires screech]
Andy: ahh! [laughs] sorry i couldn't resist. it's so quiet.
Other: i like it. it's so peaceful, i've already written like, twelve plays today.
Andy: it's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] i thought that would be cooler.
Darryl: i loved it.
Other: hey, can you pick up the pin? some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Andy: of course, i will pick up the pin. it is right here. got it.
Oscar: can we see that? did you really find it?
Andy: yes, right here. got it. dink, ow. [chuckles, clicks tongue] in the trash.
Pam: hey, why is it so quiet? shouldn't the phone be ringing? uh-oh. erin set the phone to voicemail.
Other: oh great. [overlapping chatter]
Kelly: we're screwed.
Pam: there. [phone rings]
Andy: oh! there we go! pam?
Pam: yeah?
Andy: can you get the phone?
Pam: well i'm not the receptionist.
Andy: mm, well, you used to be.
Pam: i know, but i can't cover reception. i have a ton of work to do.
Andy: phone's ringing.
Kelly: will one of you get the phone? i am freaking out! i know it's for me. [andy and pam silently argue] are you guys kidding me? stop flirting and someone get the phone!
Other: somebody! answer the phone.
Kelly: andy, pick up the phone!
Other: get the damn phone.
Other: you're the closest one to it.
Andy: fine. hello, dunder mifflin. [ringing continues] hello, you've reached dunder mifflin. how may i be of service?
Jim: man.
Other: how was the drive?
Jim: fantastic. stanley drives so fast.
Other: life is short. 'drive fast and leave a sexy corpse.' that's one of my mottoes.
Jim: i would love to hear the other mottos.
Other: quick query, halpert.
Jim: no way.
Other: still queer?
Dwight: packer.
Other: you can't put me down. too strong!
Other: yeah, dwight and jim tried to get me fired, but i landed on my feet down here in florida. you see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
Other: psst. say, 'so who's leading this thing, anyway?'
Ryan: so who's leading this thing, anyway?
Other: psst. say, 'i can't wait to meet him.'
Ryan: i can't wait to meet him.
Other: him, you say? don't think a woman can be a leader?
Ryan: i-
Other: you poor, simple boy. expected a man, did you? strong, powerful. huge, whopping penis? well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and i'm not afraid to use it. so stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] i'm nellie bertram, president of special projects. in the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. are your minds blown? so, how did this special project come about anyway? well, i interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to jim] after you decided i wasn't 'a good fit-'
Jim: it was-
Other: ah! it was. i went on a shopping spree. very destructive. i bought thirteen pianos. then i realized, what if sabre had a store? hmm? so i called jo, old friend, founder of sabre, and i told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'yes!' so let's talk about the sabre store then. probably gonna look stupid, right? like a big turd with a door on the front, right? what do you think it should look like?
Other: um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
Other: no, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
Other: well that was just one idea. it doesn't have to be winter.
Other: oh, no, it does. it does. it has to be winter, and i reject it. so i drew up a design concept. probably gonna be rubbish, right? would you like to look at it? just so you could laugh at it.
Erin: yeah!
Other: let me just get the projector working.
Dwight: uh. [eats antacids]
Jim: you got to stop with the antacids. it's not the antidote.
Dwight: you didn't poison me, it's just stress.
Jim: okay.
Dwight: what is the antidote?
Jim: true love's kiss.
Other: jim, help me lower this screen. you're a big, tall man. [points to ryan] you'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. just let go of his balloon.
Dwight: i'll do it! i always say, 'you want something done right? ask dwight.' right? dwight. right? dwight. right dwight, right dwight. sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
Other: i can do it.
Dwight: mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] there we go.
Dwight: [on phone] yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. ugh, yeah, it's tender. it can't be appendicitis, i eat more than enough bacon. okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? oh, you don't know? hold on. [to jim] what kind of poison did you use?
Jim: dwight, i didn't poison you. i was kidding.
Dwight: yeah, i'm gonna need an ambulance. hold on, i have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] hold on. hold on one second. uh, quick question. vice president, uh, who is that? there's no name listed.
Other: is there not? maybe i'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Other: sir? sir, where should we send the ambulance?
Dwight: send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
Other: i tell you what though, since my move down to florida i've really gotten back into hunting big time.
Other: hunting's so primal. almost sexual.
Other: totally. i mean, i'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
Dwight: you talking about hunting? i love hunting. i'm a master hunter.
Other: did you say 'masturbator?'
Dwight: i'm a decent baiter. my cousin mose, that's a master baiter.
Other: why are you sitting down like that?
Dwight: why is everyone else standing up? okay team, let's get back to work! break's over!
Jim: wow. are you that bored?
Other: it's just rum. i'm not bored, i'm a pirate.
Jim: is that another motto?
Other: it's whatever you want. [offers jim the bottle]
Jim: mmm.
Other: or do you only drink with your kids?
Jim: ah, let's do it. [laughs] oh, that's healthy.
Jim: i've spent so much of my life telling myself 'please, don't end up like stanley,' and now i'm wondering if i even have what it takes.
Other: we have the sabre pyramid, right? hmm? we've got a bunch of humans. you guys, humans... pyramid. human pyramid. do you follow? it's a team-building exercise. you'll love it. who's in? hmm?
Other: yup. tallahassee, let's go.
Erin: jim, are you in?
Jim: oh, i don't know.
Other: sounds like a hoot. i'm in.
Jim: all right, what the heck? let's do it.
Other: this is great. this is gonna be great.
Other: i feel like i'm in ancient egypt.
Dwight: i'll be on top. it's the most important position.
Ryan: dude, i think you have appendicitis.
Dwight: [tries to climb human pyramid] ahh!
Ryan: dwight?
Jim: dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
Dwight: everyone stop moving! everyone stop wiggling! oh, i feel like i'm gonna vomit!
Other: dude, don't you yak on me. this shirt is van heusen.
Dwight: [groans] stop moving!
Jim: no one's moving!
Dwight: oh! [collapses]
Other: oh, oh! [general commotion]
Dwight: arrest jim. he poisoned me.
Jim: wha- no. no, it was not a poisoning.
Jim: the one thing pam made sure i knew, florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
Other: you need an operation. you have appendicitis.
Ryan: oh! who called it? nothin' but net.
Erin: how long will he be gone?
Other: two or three days.
Dwight: don't remember me like this. remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Other: drama queen, am i right?
Dwight: [to phone] phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, i'm dead. you are the rightful heir to schrute farms. please, you must do one thing. kill mose before he kills you. [presses button] mose, hey, it's dwight. listen, yeah, i just want to give you a heads-up.
Other: that was an interesting diversion. shall we get back to the meeting?
Pam: whoa, are those mini pizzas?
Andy: yeah, i figured we'd keep things savory while oscar's mouth is in canker country. i also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
Kevin: look at these little mini pizzas. does this make me look huge? [giggles] hey guys, look at me, i'm huge.
Andy: hey darryl, good news, your fax went through.
Darryl: oh [bleep] yeah.
Andy: up high.
Darryl: yes sir. thanks.
Andy: dunder mifflin, this is andy. [whispers to kelly] i put out some new magazines, check it out.
Other: ah, dwell.
Andy: i'm acting like i like reception and i'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that i actually like reception, but, i mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] oh, there's the phone!
Dwight: i just got out of surgery. what's going on? fill me in.
Erin: well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
Dwight: who's doing the presentations?
Erin: packer's giving one. [dwight growls] jim'll probably give ours, i guess.
Dwight: damn it!
Erin: let's see, what else have you missed? ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. but i think i figured out a solution. what else? my shoes are gonna-
Other: #name?
Other: very good point.
Dwight: yeah todd, decent idea. obvious, but interesting.
Other: dwight, are you all right?
Dwight: i'm great. how are you?
Dwight: what's our presentation about?
Jim: dwight, will you go back to the hospital? you were there for like three hours.
Dwight: i got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Erin: do a hundred jumping jacks.
Dwight: no, i don't feel like it. you do a hundred jumping jacks.
Erin: i don't feel like it either!
Erin: [doing jumping jacks] ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
Dwight: i want that vice-presidency.
Jim: you haven't done any of the research.
Dwight: you're too slow, you're too small, seabiscuit is a stupid name.' you guys sound just like the enemies of seabiscuit. i'm going to do it.
Other: aw, let him do it.
Jim: stanley, are you listening to music?
Other: yup.
Dwight: all right, who's ready for the next presentation?
Other: ah, what is your topic?
Dwight: what is our topic? oh, what a topic it is.
Erin: retail consumer habits.
Dwight: really? okay. retail consumer habits is... [sighs] the only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. they just want to be told what to do. [erin makes the first slide appear] fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. super smart. okay.
Dwight: shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. what does this mean?
Ryan: i can field this one.
Dwight: no, sit down. 'seasonal.' well, the christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. the menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. you see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. and how does the woman console herself? shopping. shopping. just- jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? thank you. just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [jim gives dwight a bowl of ice chips] thank you. [dwight sticks his head in the bowl] oh, god. next slide.
Andy: mail call! [sings] his name is oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. his name is kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
Kevin: are those the lyrics?
Dwight: anderson's three pillars of retail. crucial. so important. next. are there any questions?
Other: what are the three pillars of retail?
Erin: [whispers] convenience.
Dwight: ingredients.
Erin: service.
Dwight: burgers.
Erin: building loyalty.
Dwight: killing royalty. the truth be told, we should really disregard anderson's three pillars. he was later diagnosed with dementia. you know what is important? is dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room i'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and i can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
Other: very true. where there's a will, there's a way. i once spent a passionate night with hugh grant's brother, john grant. he's older than hugh, just a little bit uglier. how did i pull that off? sheer force of will. that is very good, dwight.
Dwight: thank you very much. any other questions? jim?
Jim: you are bleeding through your shirt.
Dwight: oops. that's embarrassing. egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] ah.
Pam: hey, having fun?
Andy: yes i am, as a matter of fact.
Pam: well i know how it is. i know it's a lot of fun. i don't know how it is. andy, this is a lame job. what are you doing here?
Andy: i found my calling.
Darryl: andy, when i was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. i met this girl, i thought she was so perfect. i was in love with her. but when the sun came up, i knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and i had grown tired of her. i know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. she's a dog.
Pam: guys, i don't like this analogy.
Andy: [groans] ugh! fine. did you see this? [points to pens in cup]
Pam: it's nice.
Andy: i mean... [pam giggles]
Other: how are you feeling?
Dwight: amazing. just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
Other: can i see the wound?
Dwight: [show her the wound] oh god.
Other: oh! that's disgusting. that's barely healed.
Dwight: you're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
Other: a few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Dwight: that's right.
Other: that is amazing. todd, look at that.
Other: oh, yikes. incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
Dwight: ah! not so fast.
Other: would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? i feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
Other: it would be an honor, ma'am.
Dwight: i'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Dwight: i had two goals today. the first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. i achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. the second was to find a memorable souvenir for philip. for that, i do have to thank my appendix.
Andy: [answers the reception phone] dunder mifflin, how can i help you save money on paper? this is andrew.
Other: hi andrew. what happened to erin?
Andy: oh, she's on an assignment in florida for a couple of weeks.
Other: oh, good for her. she's such a sweetheart. you tell her donna muraski misses her.
Andy: i miss her too.
Other: everyone, we have a very special guest. he turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. i give you wally amos, founder of famous amos cookies. [cheers, claps]
Other: aloha, aloha, aloha. so i hear you're all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. well, back when i was regular amos-
Other: what's under the cloth?
Other: we'll get to that.
Other: cookies. bet you anything it???s cookies.
Other: it's cookies. let me- let me finish my speech first.
Other: ah, we get the gist. it's just success and effort, isn't it? so just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
Erin: famous, hi. i'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but i-
Other: is it oatmeal with no raisins?
Erin: i'm sorry to have wasted your time.
Pam: hey angela, you wanna see a picture of phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Angela: so cute.
Oscar: hey, you guys want to see a picture of gerald wearing galoshes? he refused to go out in the rain until i bought these. now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Pam: oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Angela: news flash - if you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Pam: exactly. unless you adopted, of course.
Angela: that is where we disagree.
Oscar: hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
Pam: no, three-month-old humans don't do that.
Angela: my phillip is crawling.
Pam: angela is such a liar!
Oscar: it's maddening!
Oscar: exactly. that's just like crate training. all night long, all night long.
Pam: well count yourself lucky. wait until you have two. that's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, i mean, you'll never sleep again.
Angela: no one said 'you must have two'
Oscar: like her genes are so important. the world just needs more pam/jim dna. thank you, no.
Angela: no thank you.
Andy: [laughing] check this out. my brother just got a new sailboat. he has no idea what he just got himself into. there's nothing harder than taking care of a boat???am i right?
Other: unbelievable!
Oscar: un-be-liev-a-ble.
Other: it is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. we managed to fill 40 hours somehow. that's not bad, is it?
Other: that's great.
Dwight: pretty good.
Other: well thank you. this is very helpful feedback. [dwight raises his hand] dwight, i am still not ready to name a vp.
Dwight: [laughing] that's not what i was going to ask. gosh, jump to conclusions. come on, i know, you've got so much on your plate. right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? dwight's question, figure out who's the vp?' dwight, vp. dwight, vp. dwight, vp. dwight, vp.
Other: i can't be hypnotized, dwight. i tried it, i ended up smoking more.
Dwight: can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? free them up to focus more completely on the menial. like stacking or sorting, or-
Jim: catching butterflies.
Dwight: that's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Jim: theater.
Dwight: waste of time.
Jim: dragging.
Dwight: that's just a verb.
Jim: dragging sticks.
Dwight: yes, nice, perfect. dragging sticks.
Other: alright, i'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? just??? you three, no.
Other: not good enough (clicks tongue)
Dwight: english peoples' main use today is judging american talent. [british accent] you're crap. you're wonderful. [back to american] they're mean, but they're incisive.
Other: everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. i'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Other: i'll be there at 6:00
Other: ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? maybe we'll see the real 'talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Jim: talla-nasty', very clever.
Other: thank you-
Other: wait, wait, you think she invented 'talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no???
Jim: cathy? it's been great. fun, normal. [in voiceover] i thought i was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Other: my friend and i are new here in tallahassee. would you like to get a cocktail? [jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'jim face']. maybe go out for a little dancing. beautiful day, no?
Andy: okay, everybody. 5:00. workday is over. put your pencils down. aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Pam: yes, the conference room is set up. i've got pens, i've got paper, i've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!

Andy: say what?
Pam: we're good to goooo!
Angela: stop it.
Andy: say-
Angela: stop it.
Oscar: andy.
Andy: tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the florida trip.
Pam: yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but someone dropped the ball.
Andy: ???ball droppings can be beautiful. for example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Other: jason bourne would kick bond's ass.
Other: jason bourne has no support staff. his own government's out to get him.
Dwight: genghis khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ??? what? it's true. he- he would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (jim taps dwight on the shoulder)
Other: okay, drinking game. count of three, take three sips.
Dwight: that's a stupid game. i got a great drinking game. okay, everyone empty your pockets. whoever has the most seeds is the king. whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Other: what happens if you're the hunchback?
Dwight: oh, you get kicked.
Jim: how many buttons do you have?
Dwight: (takes out bag) 40. always.
Other: can i see?
Dwight: sure. (hands bag to cathy)
Other: so, i get to kick you now.
Dwight: no, they're not transferrable just 'cause i handed 'em to you.
Other: well, that's how i played it in college.
Jim: college rules (cathy throws jim the bag and jim kicks dwight)
Dwight: aah!
Other: aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Other: ooh, double meaning! the game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. quick wit.
Other: thank you.
Ryan: i'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Erin: and i will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Other: sorry, no waffles.
Erin: oh, okay. just forget it, then. forget it. forget it.
Ryan: a waffle?
Erin: a hotel waffle. i know what i want to eat. is that crazy?
Ryan: no.
Erin: i'm moving down here, you know.
Ryan: oh, no, i didn't know.
Erin: i'm young, and i can ??? and if i can't, i'm still pretty young. i guess i'll always be young.
Ryan: you come with me. we're gonna get you that waffle.
Ryan: why would erin confide in me that she's staying here in florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, kelly ka-who run at her? (erin walks over) hey.
Erin: hey.
Pam: watson carpet and tile.
Kevin: one order.
Oscar: order reference number 00983-126.
Phyllis: eight cases, bright white inkjet.
Angela: paid.
Kelly: i'm dying!
Darryl: processed.
Other: and delivered.
Kelly: sometimes i get so bored i just want to scream, and then sometimes i actually do scream. i just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Other: i will be right back.
Other: i will be here.
Dwight: hey. i see what you're doing. it's futile. the vp position is mine.
Other: oh, please, you're through. she's going to give it to me as i'm giving it to her tonight. the cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
Dwight: well, saddles??? [clicks tongue, whinnies] ??? sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Other: what? that's a joke, right? you see the way she's all over me.
Dwight: if anyone's having sex with nellie for personal gain, it's me, and i'm not joking at all. if you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Andy: who is ready for dinner? 'oh, i bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. no. [claps] i went south of the border for this. and then i went south of that border. and we have ourselves??? [takes foil off tray] [jamaican accent] a jamaican feast, mon!
Phyllis: if i wanted jamaican food i'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Andy: additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through val. and our server is none other than brandon, her boyf!
Other: hey.
Other: how you doing, val? [val and brandon kiss]
Oscar: jamaican, huh? i just read about the elections down there. crazy stuff.
Other: oh no, i'm not actually jamaican.
Oscar: terrific.
Darryl: what's up man? i'm darryl.
Other: darryl, i heard about you. you doing good?
Darryl: oh yeah.
Other: must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend.
Other: whoa.
Kevin: dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing val. high five!
Darryl: i'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Other: brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Other: don't play dumb with me. i know what's up.
Other: honey, i am not sleeping with-
Andy: heyyy??? let's get back to the food. brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Other: hope you all like goat.
Andy: goat???
Other: blow in my ear.
Other: alright.
Other: like i'm on the beach.
Dwight: [imitates seagull calls] seagull. [continues seagull calls]
Other: and a wave crashing??? a wave crashing.
Other: oh, that is lovely.
Jim: alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. have a lovely evening.
Jim: hey, how's it going?
Other: hey, uh, good. uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. it's like 90 degrees in there. maintenance is working on it. can i hang out here?
Jim: uh??? yeah, i'm just watching basketball.
Other: okay, yeah.

Andy: thornwood wholesalers.
Kevin: one order.
Other: i read the text you sent to val, man.
Other: that's messed up.
Angela: is this spicy?
Other: no, baby girl. it would be messed up if i didn't find anything, but i did, so-
Andy: i'm pretty sure if darryl sent val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Other: at midnight?
Andy: ??? yeah???
Kevin: it happens! like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery???
Kelly: guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. i think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Andy: thank you.
Kelly: i thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Andy: kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Kelly: no. there's no way in hell i'm leaving. something interesting is happening here for once in my life, i am staying here. darryl, read the texts.
Jim: yup, coming. [opens door] all right.
Other: my mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Jim: we have plenty.
Other: oh, hello. [laughs with cathy]
Jim: do you want to watch the game with us? we're watching a game. the heat game. just a game.
Other: got it. good night. careful jim, it gets easier and easier.
Jim: no, no, no, stanley.
Other: mm-hmm. [about to leave]
Jim: stanley. stanley.
Other: uh-huh.
Jim: stanley. uhh??? you know what? just bring back those bottles!
Erin: whoa. the lights are still on.
Ryan: yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Erin: i like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Ryan: girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? and nobody knows more than you. especially me.
Erin: [gasps] hello, waffle iron.
Ryan: hello, what do we have here?
Erin: okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl???
Ryan: right.
Erin: ??? a measuring cup???
Ryan: got that. [metallic thud] get down.
Erin: [whispers] it's the fuzz!
Ryan: [whispers] shh! do you want us to get scolded? shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Darryl: i got too much ice cream. you want some?' 'getting' my fry on.'
Kelly: boring.
Darryl: uh, 'the moon is huge tonight.'
Phyllis: ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. yeah, sorry.
Darryl: that's regular text talk.
Other: you forgot one.
Darryl: you're such a great friend.'
Other: with the dots.
Darryl: you're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
Kelly: five dots, darryl, are you kidding me? okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'whoa, do not make me say what i want to say, baby, but if i did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Other: oh???
Other: see? yes. thank you, sister.
Other: brandon, darryl and me? that's ridiculous, right?
Darryl: yeah, totally crazy. puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. i'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Other: you look like ed harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Dwight: you wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ???ahhmmm??? excuse me??? what?! not now, i'm busy.
Jim: [on phone] i'm sorry, i thought you'd want to know that i saw a bedbug in my room. but, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Dwight: wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? oh no??? freak, i need a favor.
Other: well, then you have to call me by my name. gabriel susan lewis.
Dwight: i gotta be gone for a few minutes. you make sure that packer does not sleep with nellie.
Other: what's in it for gsl?
Dwight: you really want packer as your boss?
Other: got it.
Dwight: if jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. i can't risk them coming back to schrute farms. our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Dwight: where did you see it?
Jim: in the bed.
Other: i haven't seen anything.
Dwight: we gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Other: jeez???
Dwight: describe it.
Jim: brown, shiny, painful bite.
Dwight: could be a bat weevil??? describe its mood. did it seen sleepy?
Jim: stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Dwight: fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Jim: so smug. like he thought it was funny, like this.
Dwight: pshh. that's a bedbug.
Jim: yeah.
Dwight: everything's a joke.
Jim: i know.
Dwight: check your hair! [checks jim's hair]
Jim: ow.
Dwight: god, oh. so greasy, you should just shave all this.
Jim: just check it.
Dwight: you are clean. okay??? one thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] i am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] when i jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. and then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Jim: alright.
Dwight: yeah. [jumps into bed] cover me!
Other: is this really nessecary?
Jim: he knows what he's doing.
Dwight: let the bedbugs bite!
Other: ugh, god, i feel so gross. i have to go take a shower.
Jim: alright, then i will catch you later??? what do we do now?
Dwight: we wait. [shower starts] come to papa.
Jim: oh.
Jim: i don't know, dwight, i think maybe you should check again.
Dwight: nope, i wasn't bitten.
Jim: well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Dwight: oh, it's plenty warm, and i was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Jim: come on.
Dwight: if there were any in here, they would've imbedded themselves in me.
Jim: you know what? maybe they just ate.
Dwight: no, you're good. clean bill of health! besides i gotta get back downstairs. i left packer alone with nellie for way too long.
Jim: okay, they're fine. they're adults.
Dwight: no, that's the problem. packer is trying to bed nellie for the vp job unless i do it first.
Jim: is that really how you want to get this job?
Dwight: such a chorus girl.
Jim: okay, dwight??? dwight??? dwight, dwight dwight!??? uh???
Other: [in a bathrobe] is crazy gone?
Other: oh!
Other: they don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Dwight: euughh??? pathetic, huh? a real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present??? hey.
Other: yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster??? okay, cool. thanks??? i know, i'm a pig, right?
Jim: hmm? no.
Other: [giggles] wait, this why i exercise like a fiend. feel. seriously.
Jim: okay alright. [gets up] i'm really sorry, uh, i just have to say it. i'm-i'm married. i'm very happily married.
Other: oh my god, what are you thinking?
Jim: um??? i mean-
Other: i know that you're married, i sat at your wife's desk. how little do you think of me?
Jim: i'm sorry, i feel like maybe i'm-i'm i misread things. okay, let's just go back to watching.
Other: can you??? without running to the other side of the room all night?
Jim: yes, i can. [cathy laughs] uh, all right. i'm really sorry. i think we'll just??? we'll just watch. you can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. take another shower, i don't care.
Other: okay. [sits next to jim.] i am so cold.
Jim: [jim face]
Pam: hey, darryl. you okay?
Darryl: she's got a boyfriend.
Andy: play it cool, man. she'll come around.
Pam: no, you should go for it. i mean nothing would've happened with me and jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Andy: yeah, but??? my friend jim would tell you to play it cool.
Pam: my husband would tell you to go for it.
Ryan: hey.
Erin: hey.
Ryan: hey.
Erin: hey.
Ryan: hey, this is fun.
Erin: a lot of fun.
Ryan: i know. can i give you a compliment? i'm really impressed by how much you've grown. since i met you, it's like night and day.
Erin: you should move down here with me.
Ryan: yeah?
Erin: we could be roommates.
Ryan: really?
Erin: we could get a dog. we could go to r-rated movies. and who knows, i mean, you're a guy, i'm a girl-
Ryan: yeah.
Erin: maybe in six months-
Ryan: [louder] six months???? um, okay, i'm in love with kelly.
Other: put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Dwight: okay??? seven, one, one, nine???
Other: no, no, no, not numbers, no.
Dwight: no, okay.
Other: no.
Dwight: try again??? ugh, i'm still getting numbers! seven, one, one??? is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'cause please stop, okay?
Other: dwight, give me a key card to your room. meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Dwight: [gasps]wait, the numbers!
Other: mm-hmm.
Dwight: oh???
Other: mm-hmm???
Dwight: there you go.
Other: i will see you in seven-
Dwight: seven minutes. [dwight and nellie kiss]??? nellie, wait. let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to nellie]
Dwight: [in voiceover] win at all costs, don't respect women. these are the tenets i was brought up with, and they have served me well. but my ancestors never worked in corporate america, and before that, hunters. and before that, time travelers. and before that, me again. at least, that's how the legend goes. the point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. they just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
Angela: 1434-967, paid.
Darryl: it has been processed.
Other: it has been delivered.
Pam: that's it, last one.
Kelly: andy this has been an amazing night. epic.
Andy: cool-down fiesta begins right now. i got decaf coffee???
Phyllis: no way.
Andy: i got romy and michaele's high school reunion???
Other: hey. i just wanted to apologize. i mean, that was so weird. can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Darryl: sure.
Other: okay, thanks.
Darryl: hey, just so you know, me and you??? i don't think that's ridiculous??? dot, dot, dot??? dot, dot.
Jim: all right. now i think it's time for you to go.
Other: what? oh, jim, i thought we talked about this. you're cool, right?
Jim: cathy, go.
Dwight: [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] where's the bug?
Jim: awesome.
Dwight: [sprays the bed and cathy] stand back!
Other: aah! stop, it, oh my god! that burns! what is that?!
Dwight: [continues spraying the bed] it's a compound of chemicals i pulled off the maid's cart!
Other: [coughs and moans]
Jim: right there! [points to cathy]
Other: oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
Jim: [coughs] oh, big one! big one! really big one!
Other: i can't breathe!
Dwight: i think i saw it!
Other: stop it! [runs out the door]
Jim: nice job, i think you got 'em.
Dwight: you can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. if i were you, i'd just bunk with cathy.
Jim: [jim face]
Dwight: second best bananas foster i've ever had.
Jim: oh yeah? what's the first best?
Other: [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] dwight? [knocks] hello? dwight?
Jim: [whispers] is that nellie?
Dwight: [whispers] don't let-shh!
Other: are you in there? i can see the light on under your door. hello? [knocks] [dwight turns off the lights] oh, look at that. the light went off, just as i said the light went on. hello? [knocks] dwight? [whispers] dwight. [dwight eats his bananas foster]
Dwight: today is the test launch day for the inaugural sabre store. brr brr brr brr [imitating trumpet] and i, dwight schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. if i can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Ryan: are you holding this chair?
Dwight: yes.
Ryan: ???cause i feel like i???m gonna fall off.
Dwight: yes. yes.
Ryan: i???m not wearing the right shoes for this.
Dwight: we went over this, ok? your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Erin: hey strangers. so stoked for the sabre store opening.
Erin: hey, my name???s tabitha. i???m camped out in front of the sabre store so i can be first in line for the new pyramid. psst. it???s me erin. dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it???s working. there???s already people camped out behind me.
Other: test launch day, people. now, i would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. now, i know you probably all think i???m this patrician goddess. but here???s the truth. i was born in the little working class town of basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] i talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? i came from dirt, no lower than ??? what???s lower than dirt?
Dwight: loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Other: yeah, thank you. loam. bloody loam, i came from. i hit rock bottom when i auditioned for the spice girls. i didn???t even get a callback.
Jim: which spice girl?
Other: the black one. i never stood a chance.
Jim: okay.
Other: now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Dwight: okay. nellie, thank you. thank you so much.
Other: yep
Dwight: today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. and for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ??? bloggers. dossier on bloggers. bloggers are gross. bloggers are obese. bloggers have halitosis. you???re gonna love ???em. ryan is going to be the main event today. he is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world???s fair. ryan, you ready to do this?
Ryan: when people see this presentation, they???re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Dwight: okay.
Jim: come on, man.
Other: seriously disgusting.
Dwight: cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Other: ugh. kill me. that was my idea.
Dwight: packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the pyramid.
Other: uh???
Other: uh??? that is excellent.
Other: i don???t see what that gets us, but i???m a team player.
Dwight: perfect casting, right?
Other: schrute???s out to get me. but i???m playing the long game. as soon as he messes up, i swoop in like a sexual predator.
Other: i want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of e.t., candy poured out of the screen. do you understand? i wanna get goose pimples.
Dwight: speaking of pimples, let???s release the bloggers!
Andy: morning, everyone.
Kevin: oh, andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Andy: don???t care. tell me later.
Kevin: listen, it???s important. you???ve gotta hear this.
Andy: what do you got?
Kelly: oh, my god!
Phyllis: do you have a black eye?
Andy: yes, i do. phyllis.
Kevin: i woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. guess what?
Andy: what?
Kevin: it???s not a kid on a bike. it???s a man in a car.
Darryl: andy, who punched you?
Other: hey, i was on the can. what???s this about a black guy in the office?
Angela: black eye, meredith.
Kelly: will someone please explain what???s going on here? since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it???s like my life is buffering.
Andy: here???s what happened. pam and i were arriving for the day. and there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. and they were just hassling pam???
Pam: that???s true.
Andy: they had, uh??? weapons.
Pam: weapons.
Andy: i just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Pam: but these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Andy: punches were going, and i ducked a few, landed a couple, and i was fighting them off. it was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
Pam: thank goodness he was there.
Oscar: good job andy.
Kevin: yeah [all murmuring]
Andy: i didn???t do anything any of you wouldn???t have done.
Dwight: open the gates! there???s plenty for everyone. no need to panic. there???s plenty for everyone!
Other: quit it.
Dwight: there???s plenty. don???t stampede. no need to stampede, sir.
Erin: i was ahead of you!
Dwight: okay, okay. hey, hey. it???s gonna be fine. it???s gonna be fine. there???s plenty of pyramids.
Erin: come on. i was in line before you.
Other: so you???re a blogger right?
Other: yeah. blogger.
Other: god, stay away. oh, i always get in trouble around bloggers. i???m trying to be a good girl for once.
Erin: uh yeah. i already bought my pyramid, but i don???t want to leave yet. i haven???t had so much fun since seeing??? zoo-ey desh-channel at the couch-arilla music festival. so fun.
Oscar: how can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? we should call the police right now!
Andy: no.
Angela: yes.
Andy: no, no, no, no, no, we don???t need to call the police. they???ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone???s business, right, pam?
Pam: police are a hassle. we settled this on the street.
Andy: and my eye will heal. but if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Angela: why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Andy: because i have neighborhood pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Pam: 1-8-5-0-5.
Darryl: guys, guys. that???s so vague. you gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Phyllis: look, i don???t feel safe. i think we should call the police.
Angela: yes.
Andy: exactly. we need to feel safe, which is why??? toby is giving us self defense training.
Toby: me?
Andy: right toby? will you teach us self defense?
Toby: yeah, um... i can???t believe you remembered. i do self-defense. um, i???ll go put on my cup.
Andy: great.
Other: yes!
Other: okay.
Other: i wasn???t really sure which one of you is chuck.
Jim: [on phone] yeah, no, it seems to be going great. andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Other: look at that guy. he???s got his sabre phone on, and he???s not even using it.
Other: this is a perfect photo for my daily fail blog.
Jim: uh, i - i gotta go. okay.
Other: dwight, what is a fail? that sounds bad.
Dwight: oh, no, no, no. it???s good. it???s really -- on the internet, it???s a really -- that???s a really good, good, thing.
Dwight: are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Jim: i???m very sorry.
Other: we gave you an arrowhead for free for the day. how hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ???hello. hi sweetie. it???s jim. i???m calling you from the new arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. and my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.???
Jim: i???m really sorry. is there anything i can do, maybe pretend to be chuck?
Dwight: you could have pretended to be chuck. i begged you to pretend to be chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be chuck! ??surrender the tripack. you know what you have to do.
Dwight: point it towards the store, idiot!
Dwight: [laughs] you know what i mean? one of these buttons is -- damn it. take over.
Dwight: oh hey, hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. listen. excuse me, sir. yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. okay. so long. here we go. erin! psst! come on! the elderly suck the life out of the young. get them out of here!
Erin: we are closed! come on.
Toby: self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? this is about escaping with your life. so... strike, scream, and run. all right? let???s try it.
Other: [smacks meredith???s head] [screams] [runs out]
Other: ow.
Toby: that may have been my fault.
Other: what the hell, toby?
Toby: okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you???re not gonna have to time to think, okay? so just remember, i-a-a-t-g. ???it???s all about the groin.???
Andy: what if you???re being attacked by a ??? smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
Toby: i don???t think that???s very common.
Andy: what if you???re being attacked by a 4???11??? man who is penisless?
Oscar: why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Andy: why don???t we start with the basics? show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Toby: well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
Andy: so in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? what can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
Toby: it???s interesting that you???re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ??you would like the turn of the table. okay, the latest chad flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, dr. lucifer wu.
Angela: can i please leave? i have a rape flute.
Toby: all right, well, let???s try one simple technique together. okay, why doesn???t everyone stand? okay, so... you???re being attacked. you???ve got your hands up. simple palm strike to the chin. up to the chin. one, two.
Other: one, two.
Andy: [softly] take that, kid.
Dwight: cathy, i would like to introduce you to fatty gruesome. he is a freelancer for wired magazine.
Other: patty grossman. i???m a woman.
Dwight: but you still work for wired, right?
Other: yes.
Dwight: good! okay. flirt away.
Ryan: sabre. it???s time to come home.
Jim: yeah. yeah, i mean, i think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Ryan: yeah, no [bleep], sherlock! can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before i go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Dwight: okay. i know, i know, champ. calm down, just listen.
Ryan: you know what?
Dwight: you just need to realize that so much rides on this. you have no idea.
Jim: dwight.
Dwight: i???m trying to make him feel important.
Ryan: god. i wish kelly were here. she always knew what to say.
Dwight: um... [imitating kelly] oh, ryan, you???re so smart. you???re smarter than mark zuckerberg and those google guys all combined. hee hee hee.
Ryan: you???re so ignorant. you barely know what you???re talking about. that is so ridiculous. you really need to read a couple books.
Dwight: what???s a book? [giggles]
Ryan: on my god. you???re so embarrassing. ??my mom would say the best stuff, though.
Jim: [ahem] you can... [slightly effeminate] you can do it ryan.
Ryan: and you know that i???m capable of this.
Jim: you???re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Ryan: what did you think of the presentation?
Jim: i thought it was great, sweetie. i would just fix that one --
Ryan: oh! ???fix??? means you hate it! i knew it! i need something to drink!
Dwight: jim, get him a water.
Ryan: no, not a water. a sports drink. i hate everything in that fridge. not red! get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. not red!
Dwight: why are you just standing there? go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Toby: now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you???re alive.
Other: forgive me for interrupting. i believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?
Andy: [deep voice] i think you guys might have the wrong office.
Other: that???s him... the guy i hit.
Darryl: what?
Oscar: you???ve gotta be kidding me.
Kevin: poor andy! first you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
Oscar: no, kevin -- [sighs]
Other: what about the lady you hit with the pine cone?
Other: there. that chubby one.
Pam: i just had a baby.
Other: yesterday?
Pam: wow.
Other: apologize.
Other: sorry i kicked your ass in front of your ???thin??? girlfriend.
Pam: how ???bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
Other: you know what? tiffy???s going to college.
Andy: [deep voice] listen, i don???t know what you guys are talking about, but i guess i???ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
Other: god bless. friend of mine uses your paper. you do good work. bye bye.
Kevin: bye.
Kelly: so, toby, i think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- ???how to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.???
Toby: there???s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. my ex-wife used to demolish me.
Kelly: no, there is shame in it, okay? we have to draw the line somewhere.
Darryl: oh my god, i think i see the imprint of a ring pop.
Andy: oh... [kelly laughing]
Dwight: have you seen erin?
Other: i???m on break.
Dwight: oh god... ??hey no! where do you think you???re going? you???ve gotta stay for the big presentation we???ve got this young wiz kid -- ryan. he???s like an even more handsome bill gates.
Other: when???s the presentation?
Dwight: it???s moments away. just stay here!
Ryan: [on phone] hey uncle lucas, it???s your nephew ryan. honestly, i could use a prescription for ritalin right now. well, i know you did one for aunt carol. oh, so it???s different because it???s your wife? ??well, that doesn???t make any sense to me.
Other: how you doing?
Ryan: don???t talk to me right now. i???m sorry. i- i know you???re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. what i don???t understand is... [voice fades]
Other: [to dwight] your little man is unraveling. now go and fix it.
Erin: sorry about kicking you out. it???s just, we don???t want our brand associated with death.
Other: it???s okay. i???ll go to the costco and search for handsome men.
Erin: you???re not married yet?
Other: [laughs] oh, i was. my husband was my best friend. he passed away.
Erin: my best friend was my boss, andy. we dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we???re not really friends.
Other: someone rejected you? with that body and those bazongas? forget him!
Erin: yeah! forget him! and you should forget your husband.
Other: well...
Dwight: how long has he been in the bathroom?
Jim: about ten minutes.
Dwight: jeez! what???s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Jim: oops, that???s my phone. am i allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
Dwight: are there any bloggers around?
Jim: it???s ryan. ???i???m sorry. i lied. i???m not in the bathroom. i can???t do it. i need to see my mom. i???m going home.???
Other: what is the delay here? where???s ryan? why is he not here?
Dwight: i had to send him home. as brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
Jim: uh...
Other: what?
Dwight: that???s right. will you just give us a second?
Other: you are gonna bloody ruin it. you???re gonna bloody ruin it because you???re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
Jim: okay.
Other: that???s....
Dwight: jim --
Jim: i???m not doing the presentation.
Dwight: look at me. look at me! look... at... this... face. this is not the face of a performer. this is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. i???m telling you... if you don???t do this, [whispers] i don???t stand a chance. please, jim.
Jim: okay, i???ll do it.
Dwight: oh, my god. o... kay! go get into ryan???s costume and check out his notes.
Jim: a costume?
Dwight: of course there???s a costume! [laughs] ??oh, this is gonna be great. there???s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Dwight: did you pass out in there? what is taking so long?
Jim: i???ve been in here for 20 seconds.
Dwight: hurry up. let me in. i wanna watch you get dressed. did you find the eyeliner?
Jim: i???m not wearing eyeliner.
Dwight: you are wearing eyeliner, jim.
Jim: time. space. gender. [dwight mouthing words] there are no rules anymore. all boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. the only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] no, that???s --
Dwight: it???s true.
Jim: this... is the future, because... this is the past. i???ve been through a lot of issues in my life. i???ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. i???ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
Dwight: yep.
Jim: when i was ten years old, my parents took me to disney world. i cried the whole time. i was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ??i just wanted... to go home. ??this is what the pyramid will do for you. it is the bridge to the world. it has a usb port. wireless... will be available in 2013. ??you can play anything from chuck to cars 2. with the pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
Other: ahhhhhh
Dwight: psst.
Jim: oh.
Ryan: [image on pyramid] sabre... it???s time... to come home.
Other: [applause]
Jim: all right. ??thank you so much. wow. wow! and good night! [applause continues]
Jim: yeah. ??thank you. thank you.
Toby: okay, this isn???t over. let???s stay focused, okay? ??we made fun of andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
Kevin: whether it???s a gremlin or chucky the doll. the key is to throw it in something. like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Toby: okay. good point...
Angela: good point? what is a tub of electricity?
Toby: i don???t... i don???t...
Oscar: with all due respect we know what we???re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Kelly: i was a twelve year old bully.
Angela: great! i think kelly should attack toby.
Other: yeah.
Kelly: yeah, that???s not a bad idea, actually, because i have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Angela: thanks.
Kelly: good. let???s go.
Toby: i don???t know if this is gonna help...uh...
Angela: let???s go kelly.
Toby: we should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
Kelly: you think you???re so pretty! ??well you???re not gonna be so pretty come prom time!
Toby: okay, this is what???s called pre-violent posturing.
Kelly: take that! ??not so pre-violent anymore!
Toby: okay, i???m at what???s called ???the decision point.???
Andy: hey, hey, hey. kelly kelly, kelly... come on.... ow! god! my good eye!
Pam: [laughs] oh boy. oh no, i???m not laughing at you. i???m laughing at, um, something that cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. this morning.
Andy: you know why i got hit by girls? because i stood up for others. pam and for toby. ??i stepped in and i didn???t care that i was standing up to girls. you may wanna ask yourselves, ???where were you when the girls came????
Andy: tough day. yes. but i feel good. i put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ??i just feel good!
Dwight: okay, okay, i will be the first to admit it. ??we could have integrated more chuck into the presentation.
Other: dwight. ??you???re the vice president.
Dwight: ha, ha, ha, ha! yeah!
Other: [squealing]
Dwight: okay! come on!
Other: aagh!
Dwight: hah! yah! [kicking and punching the air] boom!
Andy: [exiting office] everyone stop what you're doing, i have terrible news. dwight is no longer with us.
Other: [gasps] what?! why is that?
Andy: he's gone, damn it! he's been promoted to vp of sabre retail and he's staying in florida forever.
Angela: so, he's alive.
Andy: yeah. that was him on the phone. he sounds wonderful.
Angela: well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
Andy: how could i have been more clear? he had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
Phyllis: if dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Oscar: you guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on dwight's desk]
Oscar: when the team left for tallahassee, dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'don't touch my treasure. ok, you understand?'] obviously he wants us to obsess about it. there's nothing in there. [has realization] which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. oh god, i'm wallace shawn in the princess bride.
Andy: i think that dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
Oscar: i am dying to know what's in there.
Andy: yeah, i know, oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. you'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at creed]
Other: hi, hello.
Andy: [to creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] now, carefully... open the box.
Other: [opens box, pulls out and displays contents] it's a photo of all of us.
Pam: aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
Dwight: [feigning surprise] a dart? are you kidding me? who would put a poison dart, well, i mean, i don't know that it's poison. i mean, i just have to imagine. god, i'm glad he's ok though. kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. wow!
Dwight: [on a golf course] well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. now, give my regards to hell. da! [hits ball]
Other: oh, all right! well swung my vip vp.
Other: i am loving the chemistry between you two.
Other: i am so happy dwight is gonna be working alongside me. we are a regular archibald and his man george.
Other: i bet. i'm excited.
Other: trick... there's no such thing. it's not even a real english duo.
Dwight: ah!
Other: i just made you look like the goat of dover. and that doesn't exist either.
Dwight: [to robert] you think you're excited? you should feel my nipples. [robert gives a fake laugh]
Jim: oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] little something from all of us. [hand dwight a small wrapped gift]
Dwight: [sarcastically] oh my gosh, thank you jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] four! [smashes gift] oh yeah!
Other: he doesn't even care.
Dwight: don't even care!
Jim: this is the last time i'll ever see dwight. it's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? it's not, it's not bittersweet. it's uh... sweet. yeah.
Darryl: [entering andy's office] hey, man. selling cookies for jada. want the same as last year?
Andy: would if i could. and i can so i will. put me down for one box. don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
Darryl: i'll put you down for shortbreads.
Andy: damn it.
Toby: [entering andy's office] knock, knock. hey, sasha's first year in the troops, so i'm selling cookies for her. anyway, would you like some?
Darryl: no. no.
Toby: what?
Darryl: i been selling here for five years. this is my spot.
Toby: you can't claim territories. this is the only place i interact with people. can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [darryl looks hurt] or chess club, or?
Darryl: you know what? it's your first time, let's split the office. you can have sales, the annex, creed, and i don't know i'll just take, uh, accounting.
Toby: that's it? yeah, well, ok. thanks darryl.
Darryl: ok, great.
Darryl: [exits andy's office smiling] all i need is kevin. dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [kevin waves at him] when i first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. not a thin man, mind you. relatively thin.
Erin: [entering a home carrying groceries] hellosi, i'm home, babaloo.
Other: [rises from chair] oh, here let me help.
Erin: [spilling groceries] i got it. it was so busy at the store today. really good cheese samples. i had, like, a hundred.
Erin: irene hired me as her live-in helper. we met at the store launch. i told her i was moving here and i needed a place and it just sort of made sense. i basically do everything for her. [erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] i run errands. i do chores around the house. i cook and clean. honestly, i don't know how she survived without me.
Other: when can i introduce you to my grandson? he's a wonderful swimmer. shallow end, deep end. he does it all.
Erin: well, today might be kind of tough, irene. i have to talk to my old boss, andy, and tell him i'm staying in florida. [hands irene a mug]
Other: [takes mug] thank you. [takes a sip] oh, what kind of tea is this?
Erin: oh, i boiled some gatorade.
Other: [misses putt] ah. in england, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. we'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
Other: if i may, [assists nellie] try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. and your thumbs here.
Other: oh.
Other: that's right. your little finger.
Darryl: [approaches kevin] would you like to buy some cookies?
Kevin: cookies, eh?
Kevin: [singing] oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. and fall time thinks that it's the best. cold time has, kind of a strut. and valentine's thinks that it's the best. but gather round, peeps, i'll tell you the truth. nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Darryl: [kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] it's not a scratch-and-sniff, kev.
Kevin: i know. but sometimes you still get a little something.
Toby: [to darryl] hey, you tricked me. you just wanted kevin.
Darryl: you're new to the game. you learned a lesson today. see you next year, sport.
Toby: no, no, no. it's not fair. what if kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
Kevin: i do.
Toby: see?
Darryl: that doesn't mean anything. [to kevin] kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
Kevin: oh, i definitely do.
Darryl: [to toby] huh. hit the road, jack.
Toby: no, you hit the road, jack.
Kevin: [looking pleased] hey guys, come on. don't fight over me.
Toby: you know, why don't we split the order? it's only fair.
Kevin: no. wait, no. i'm buying, i make the rules. i actually do want you to fight over me. i wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
Angela: ugh.
Kevin: metaphorically 69ed. ew. perverts... no offence oscar. [oscar looks flabbergasted]
Other: hop in, we have places to be. no rest for the wicked.
Jim: [to dwight] all right. so... i guess this is it.
Dwight: well, jim, i just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, i've even hated your guts. but...[smiles] bye, bye. i win.
Jim: [attempts to shake dwight's hand] goodbye, dwight.
Dwight: [drops golf ball into jim's open hand] robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Jim: well, he's florida's problem now.
Other: i'll let dwight have his fun. today will not be his day.
Jim: what's that?
Other: i'm gonna tank the sabre store at the presentation to the board.
Jim: i thought you liked the store?
Other: well, the store is lovely. you created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. great job. cheers.
Jim: thank you.
Other: but, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. have you ever used sabre electronics, jim? [jim shakes head] they're cheap. they're unintuitive. the sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us.
Jim: wow. when you put it that way, i guess it does sound pretty terrible.
Other: i couldn't just kill the project from the start. jo bennett endorsed it. shame though, i did like dwight.
Dwight: [from distanced golf cart] robert! i'm gonna win, ha ha, i'm the gentleman! suck it!
Other: [to dwight] bravo, dwight! very good! [jim looks surprised] [to jim] shame.
Dwight: [at sabre headquarters] the math is simple folks. deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise sabre [nellie emerges from behind dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Other: how did that look?
Other: i'm not just saying this, that was the best thing i've ever seen.
Dwight: [to nellie] i told you.
Other: when you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout i pop up also? i guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to nellie] you'd spin off right. i'd spin off-
Dwight: you know what? that is a great idea. cathy, write that down and print it out. it's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
Jim: [enters room] all right. there he is.
Dwight: what are you doing here? i thought i got rid of you?
Jim: can i just talk to you for one quick second?
Dwight: what, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
Jim: um, actually it's, it's for your own good. i think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Dwight: you want to do something for my own good? turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Other: nice. [to jim] hey, halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like wooly willy?
Dwight: [to packer] silence.
Other: aw, i'm just trying to-
Dwight: [interrupts] i know what you're trying to do, i don't want it. [to jim] but your face does look like the guy from operation.
Other: that's... that's the same guy. it's the joke i made.
Dwight: different guy.
Jim: you know, i just think you should know that-
Dwight: [interrupts] that you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
Jim: well, i tried. [gestures the meeting room] you saw it, so, it's on the record. i have a plane to catch.
Erin: can you help me? i'm trying to make a video chat with andy.
Other: just open the program and type in his user name.
Erin: can you just do it?
Other: [after briefly typing] here, type in your password.
Erin: erin123'
Other: that's a terrible password. and you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat.
Erin: [annoyed] all right.
Andy: [video chat begins, andy's head enters the screen from the side] hello?
Erin: that's so weird. there's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] oh. i fixed it.
Andy: oh, now mine's broken. hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] oh, there we go.
Pam: [on phone with jim] he said, 'i did like dwight'? he's gonna fire him.
Jim: no, no, i think it was more like, 'you know, i liked him, but i don't anymore because he did a bad job, so i'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Pam: robert doesn't talk like that. you have to stop dwight from doing this.
Jim: i tried. he will not listen.
Pam: did you actually try your hardest?
Jim: yes... my pretty hardest. look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. he's like super dwight. it's like he's been bitten by a radioactive dwight, or som- stanley, back me up.
Other: don't talk to me.
Jim: stanley's very upset that we're leaving florida. but he would back me up.
Pam: if dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. just get the words out. that's all you can do.
Jim: ok. all right.
Darryl: [to kevin] what's a skinny guy like toby know about cookies? you can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. maybe toby from two years ago.
Phyllis: [laughs] yeah.
Kevin: that's true. if i have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am i gonna call? darryl. toby's probably in bed with some model.
Darryl: thank you.
Toby: i'm, i'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
Darryl: look, i need this. ok? your daughter is a pretty little girl. let her go door-to-door. you think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Phyllis: oh. [looks away]
Darryl: baby, if you???re watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. daddy's just got to sell some cookies. and we're also gonna exercise more. it's gonna be fun.
Kelly: [to kevin] oh, you know what you have to do? to decide? you need to make them do things for you. and, like, buy you things.
Pam: or have them sing that song! that the frog does in looney tunes.
Phyllis: make them kiss each other.
Other: make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [toby and darryl look at each other]
Erin: yes, this is too tan. this right here-
Andy: no.
Erin: this is a tanned spot.
Andy: i don't buy it. it, that is a freckle. that is not a tan, ok? i'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. i want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
Erin: well, andy, i'm not coming back.
Andy: what?
Erin: i have a job here. i work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put irene into view]
Other: [waves] hello!
Erin: andy?
Andy: yeah, that's awesome. that's great.
Kevin: [toby and darryl perform hello! ma baby] this is tough. 'cause darryl, you sang better and you dance better but toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. i think i've reached my decision. i have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Darryl: no, no, no, no. it's not worth it.
Toby: no.
Kevin: no, it's not worth it? that's too bad. 'cause i was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Darryl: yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
Kevin: hungrier.
Toby: 50?
Kevin: hungrier.
Darryl: you're not talking... triple digits?
Kevin: oh yeah, i'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while toby and darryl look at each other] again. [both start performing hello! ma baby again]
Dwight: [straightens tie in mirror] showtime.
Jim: [enters abruptly] dwight.
Dwight: you again? gosh, i keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. you're like an amish return stick.
Jim: ok, great, listen to me. listen to me. [dwight makes funny gesture] no, no, i know. will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Dwight: yes, you may tell me one thing. wait, you want to borrow money?
Jim: listen to me. robert is going to veto the sabre store.
Dwight: [rolls eyes] jim, come on.
Jim: dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
Dwight: uh-huh.
Jim: and then, i'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Dwight: wait. [holds up fingers] he's gonna kill the store? and he's gonna fire me?
Jim: yes.
Dwight: [smiles] that's two things.
Jim: dwight, please.
Dwight: nice try, jim. your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Jim: ok, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Dwight: you know what? you might want to get to the airport. it's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. bye.
Jim: dwight, come o-
Dwight: nothing is gonna stop me. that is the mark of a great man. unstoppability. dunder-mifflin, the farm, mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. now, if you'll excuse me, i have a date with destiny. and from what i hear, she's a slu- ah![jim tackles dwight]
Dwight: [jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] help! help!
Jim: gross! don't lick my hand! god, why is there so much saliva?
Dwight: ali had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Jim: gross!
Dwight: [attempting to break from jim's grasp] ah!
Jim: what? what, what, what, what, what?
Dwight: [clutching side] oh, god! you... oh! my appendix-
Jim: i'm sorry.
Dwight: my wound hasn't healed yet.
Jim: i'm so sorry, i forgot.
Dwight: oh, man!
Jim: you all right? you ok?
Dwight: [stops whining and charges jim] rrrah!
Other: [to cathy] where the hell is he? i cannot do this without him.
Other: i don't know. he's not picking up.
Other: well, looks like shnoot's a no-show. guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. but i am. put me in, babe. i got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. i'm your man.
Other: [considers and decides on packer] right, let's begin then. ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of sabre retail, mr. todd packer.
Other: sup?
Phyllis: [notices andy boxing up things from erin's desk] what are you doing?
Andy: i'm just dealing with erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. and she didn't bother to tell anyone.
Oscar: we knew. ryan told us.
Andy: ryan, why didn't you tell me?
Ryan: thought you checker my tumblr?
Andy: you never update it.
Ryan: well, i updated it.
Andy: does anyone else think this is weird? and like, kind of uncool, actually? to leave us without a receptionist?
Pam: we'll find another receptionist. i mean, that's easy. we'll be fine. [andy nods reluctantly]
Dwight: [trying to get around jim] huh, huh, huh! [slides between jim's legs]
Jim: what are you doing?
Dwight: i was trying to go-
Jim: get up.
Dwight: ok, ok.
Jim: get up. all right? i'm not gonna let you by.
Dwight: then you know what? i'm just gonna have to run right through you.
Jim: ok. [dwight runs in place] what are you doing? are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Dwight: [tries to jump off wall] jackie chan! [falls and groans]
Kevin: [holding mobile phone up] go.
Darryl: [in a feminine voice] hi. this is alex.
Toby: [in feminine voice] and this is sam.
Darryl: [in a feminine voice] kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Kevin: perfect! now people will think i'm doing hot girls all day.
Darryl: i don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Toby: yeah, i don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
Kevin: okay, now who do i ride to the kitchen like a pony?
Toby: don't make me be your pony, kevin.
Darryl: forget it, man.
Kevin: what do you mean?
Darryl: i'm out. and so is toby.
Darryl: this may be wrong. but there's a limit to what i would do for my child.
Toby: yeah. i have my dignity too. i refuse to be another man's horsey.
Kevin: no guys, stop! you have to sell me cookies. i'll do anything. [starts performing hello! ma baby] i'm even gonna kiss meredith. [kisses meredith] that is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
Jim: [tackled by dwight] what are you doing? no. no, no, no.
Dwight: this. ends. now.
Jim: this is dangerous.
Dwight: [picks jim up] rrahh! [both fall]
Jim: why?
Dwight: anything else you need to talk about?
Jim: nope. i think that was it. [dwight gets up and walks away]
Dwight: [looking disheveled in mirror] once again, it's show time.
Other: what baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, [dwight enters] which the great jo bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution.
Other: if i may speak to that, i have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is dwight shrute.
Other: i don't see dwight. he clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.
Other: whatever you do, do not blame todd packer. it is not his fault. blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. fire the employee, yes... but not the man. you may not cancel his soul.
Other: that was never on the table.
Other: [to nellie] are you kidding? [to robert] she's the queen of the whole freaking magilla!
Other: and yet todd, it's you who's fired.
Other: what, you, i, i can't get fired. i'm an institution. i have been at this company for 20 years. how many of you have been here that long, huh? [dwight exits meeting room and helps jim up]
Darryl: [dwight and jim enter office] hey, hey. they're back. [everyone greets them]
Kelly: dwight, what are you doing here? i thought you were supposed to be in florida?
Jim: yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. did you lose some weight?
Kelly: thank you, for someone who actually notices this. no, i didn't lose weight. but i started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. i actually put on five pounds.
Phyllis: [to stanley] hey! good to have you back.
Other: [insincerely] good to be back.
Pam: [to jim] hey, stranger!
Jim: hey.
Pam: aw, i missed you.
Jim: i missed you. [they embrace and kiss as andy watches on sadly]
Pam: aw.
Andy: i'm going to florida to get erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] forgot to turn off my email. it's crazy, right? it's just, when she said she was leaving, i felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'you're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' yes. i am sure. ah, slow computer!
Pam: [telephone ringing] this is pam. oh my god, are you sure? uh, okay. okay, um, we???ll be right there. everybody, the balloon is falling.
Kevin: nice.
Pam: there???s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. and, okay, it???s not -- it doesn???t sound cool. you just have to see it.
Pam: well, i guess it doesn???t look that cool either. but, it???s been up there a long time, so it???s become a pretty big deal.
Jim: wow. it???s the end of an era.
Pam: did a good job, buddy. now it???s time to come home.
Oscar: i remember when that balloon went up there. i was still with gil. we were so happy.
Kevin: when that went up there, i had hair like rapunzel.
Ryan: how long do you think it???s been up there, kevin?
Kevin: i just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ???look, a balloon.???
Dwight: my warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Other: my kid didn???t have a face tattoo.
Darryl: i was still thinking of going back to school.
Jim: and i was still just a paper salesman.
Dwight: well this has been fun, pam. thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Other: kill the balloon. kill the balloon. kill the balloon. kill the balloon. kill the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause]
Jim: hey. so they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. who wants it?
Kevin: oooh
Darryl: me.
Phyllis: yeah.
Dwight: right here.
Other: allow me to solve your problem, then.
Jim: nellie
Other: mmm. [bites sandwich] oh, that is disgusting. do you call that a king james breakfast pie?
Jim: what brings you to town?
Other: certainly not the harry houdini museum. what a nobody. oh look, some hungarian just found their way out of a sack. let's build a shrine. no, i've come to work here.
Dwight: what?
Dwight: how could robert transfer nellie here after the sabre store debacle? she stinks of failure. the fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. i should know. i'm in an identical situation.
Toby: robert did say you'd be joining us. welcome. i'm tony.
Other: mm.
Pam: what?
Toby: i- i said i'm tony. okay i made a mistake. i thought it might go unnoticed. but uh, i'm toby.
Pam: you messed up saying your name?
Toby: it happens, okay? uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, i'm sure robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Other: that one looks empty.
Jim: no, that's andy's office.
Other: oh, is it?
Other: i have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. it's how i came to briefly race a formula one car. the three slowest laps ever recorded.
Erin: another beautiful day in tallahassee. ooh. good morning, alonzo.
Other: good morning erin. [driving by delivering newspapers]
Erin: how are you? how's your family doing?
Erin: bye.
Erin: look at this place! five rooms, and i get to clean them all. that's right. i'm a maid for an old lady. her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] listen to me, bragging away.
Other: nellie.
Other: robert.
Other: how are you adjusting to life in scranton so far?
Other: so far, so good.
Other: good.
Other: water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Other: ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?
Other: mm-hm.
Other: now. let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?
Other: oh, i've already found it. i am manager, a natural next step. it fits like a glove.
Other: we have a manager.
Other: do you really? because it is 10:00. i've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Other: excuse me, has anyone seen andy this morning?
Kevin: huh. yeah, that's weird. he's usually here by now. right guys?
Andy: [on phone] hello.
Other: andy, it's robert. why aren't you at work?
Andy: hey, robert. ah, i really wish i could come in to work today, but i'm super sick.
Other: i don't care, i don't care. please come to work immediately.
Andy: okay, i'll try to come in even though i'm really sick with the...
Andy: [standing in ocean] ...florida flu.
Other: he just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Andy: i'm in florida to get erin. as soon as i heard she wasn't coming back to scranton, i jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till i hit the ocean. my heart is my map. turns out, tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so i overshot a good amount. but still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] oh, no. thanks a lot, bp.
Other: not much we can do about this until he gets here.
Jim: can't you do something about this?
Other: sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, jim.
Jim: #name?
Jim: what is going on? and where's andy? and what is going on?
Other: erin, you got a package.
Erin: i'm in the bathroom.
Other: where's the postage? i mean, there's no shipping label.
Other: did you wash your hands?
Erin: yes.
Other: [screaming as andy busts out of box]
Andy: [singing] here i am; signed, sealed, delivered; i'm yours!
Erin: andy, what are you doing here? it's great to see you.
Andy: uh, i am here to take you back to scranton. because i love you and i want to be with you.
Other: where's the ring?
Andy: hm?
Other: where's the ring, lancelot?
Erin: uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? sorry, glenn.
Erin: um, andy... i am so happy to see you. but i'm not coming back with you.
Other: [whispering off screen] why won't she go with him?
Other: [whispering] i don't know. maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.
Erin: hey... don't listen.
Other: so what is going on? that does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in american accent] hey, this is messed up, bro. who is this weird lady? [normal voice] i know. it's a lot. so, who knows what's going on? anyone? you, yes. wait, i am very good at intuiting names. is it... chumbo?
Jim: i think it's a cross between dumbo and jumbo, with a hint of chubby. it's not a name.
Other: so no one can tell me what's going on. well, let me illuminate things for you. we are getting to know each other. [in american accent] but why, m'lady? [in normal voice] because i am your new manager.
Pam: robert, is nellie our new manager?
Other: [laughs] this is an odd situation. but it's very interesting how it's playing out.
Other: we live in this world of routines and rhythms. kevin ate someone's lunch. phyllis has a new necklace. who is this woman?
Other: i came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. and what i got in return was nothing but disrespect. you leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Kevin: hot tub party?
Other: performance reviews.
Pam: how can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
Other: on first impressions, so i recommend smiling. it goes a long way with me.
Other: erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
Erin: oh, thanks. i've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. it's only going to keep getting better.
Other: so, andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?
Andy: well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, i mean, i just have to cross a few ts and dot a few i's, you know.
Erin: so you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Other: i think you should leave, young man.
Andy: all right. technically, yes, i am still technically dating jessica. but when i realized that i wanted you back, i just jumped in the car and i drove down here, and i didn't want to stop until i saw you.
Erin: you didn't even stop to pee? gross.
Jim: any luck?
Pam: no. he just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Andy: [on phone message, singing] please leave a message for andy bernard, include your na-
Erin: oh, you're doing so good. oh my god, you're superman over there. [andy's phone vibrating]
Other: you should take it. it's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
Andy: nope. it's just work. not important. you know, i can really feel this is my quads, i can tell i'm getting stronger.
Other: you really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session.
Andy: i don't know. [phone vibrating] just let it vibrate. it's fine.
Other: you could put it on silent.
Andy: i don't think it does that.
Other: just go to preferences, then click ???
Other: [answering andy's phone] proctology.
Jim: [on phone] andy?
Andy: jim?
Jim: andy, where are you?
Andy: i- i'm home in bed. i've been in bed all day. i got the-- i got the serious poops, man.
Other: he's here in tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.
Jim: what? you're in florida? andy, nellie bertram's trying to take your job.
Andy: what do you mean, take my job?
Jim: like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Andy: okay... jim, i really appreciate you looking out for me, but i'm not coming home without erin. so i'll talk to you later.
Jim: guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? if we go into them, you're basically accepting nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Angela: trust you? the way pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Pam: i like working here.
Jim: dwight, should she be our manager?
Dwight: i wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Dwight: those who can't farm, farm celery.
Jim: and when was the last time dwight and i agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Other: all right. let's get going. first up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, phyllis.
Phyllis: nellie, i'm sorry, but i don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone i don't know.
Other: oh. oh, okay. i understand. let me show you how these are gonna go. dwight.
Dwight: i refuse to be judged by someone that i do not respect. i lost respect for you in florida. if it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Other: dwight, i have completed your evaluation. you're getting a raise.
Dwight: what?
Other: dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. you are our atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Dwight: there's no limit to what i think i deserve.
Other: then you accept it?
Dwight: five percent. no less.
Other: absolutely not. seven percent.
Dwight: six percent, i know my worth.
Jim: the raise isn't real.
Dwight: money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Other: so phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. would you care to have a go? i'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Pam: phyllis.
Phyllis: pam.
Other: so, phyllis, i have been very impressed with you.
Phyllis: really?
Other: oh, yeah. the way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
Jim: um... are you aware that nellie is giving out raises?
Other: i am not. huh.
Jim: yeah. she gave one to dwight, phyllis.
Other: let me guess, you want one too? take the family to disneytown?
Jim: land. world. uh, it's not that i don't want a-- well, yes, i guess i'd take a raise. that's not what i'm saying. that's not-- sorry.
Other: jim, i told andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. by contrast, nellie bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. to make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with jo bennett, my boss.
Jim: yes.
Other: jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
Jim: oh, god, nature, please.
Other: when two animals are having sex, one of them...
Jim: [exhales sharply]
Other: ??? is communicating a message to the other. nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. you're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
Jim: was that not the--
Other: all life is sex. and all sex is competition.
Jim: mm-hm.
Other: and there are no rules to that game. that wasn't so perverted, now was it?
Jim: was that it? no, that wasn't bad.
Other: my point is, there is one person in charge of every office in america, and that person is charles darwin. in the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
Jim: no. i would've said no.
Other: mm, let's see, review, review, review. yes, good stuff. here you go, have a raise.
Kelly: oh, great.
Jim: i mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? that it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? shouldn't work like that.
Dwight: no, you know what? nellie's right. that is exactly how it should work. darryl, this office is mine now.
Darryl: no.
Dwight: yes.
Darryl: no.
Dwight: yes.
Darryl: no.
Dwight: yes.
Darryl: no.
Dwight: yes.
Darryl: no.
Dwight: yes. yes, sorry too late. i'm here. this is mine. back off.
Dwight: [darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] ow! ow, ow, ow. ow, ow, ow, ow.
Dwight: [panting] well fought. i accept the outcome.
Other: touch me and i'll sue.
Erin: i've heard that's amazing when it works.
Andy: yeah, if i had my own--
Erin: andy, i care about you and i think--
Andy: #name?
Erin: no, go ahead.
Andy: well, i was just going to say that, if i had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. it's just stupid. what were you going to say?
Erin: andy, you broke my heart. do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Andy: you broke my heart too.
Erin: you broke my heart more recently and more often. and i think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
Andy: i'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
Erin: i know.
Andy: [sighs]
Other: so, pamela, i'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Pam: really? okay, well, um, i like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. stuff like that. i'm easy.
Other: that's not really what you want. what you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
Pam: whoa, that's kind of condescending. would you say something like that to jim?
Other: does jim have to breastfeed? did jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? be honest, does jim really get up in the night?
Pam: well, i mean, the only reason he doesn't is because i'm breastfeeding, and phillip doesn't like a bottle.
Other: you must be exhausted. fancy a nap?
Pam: no.
Other: go on. have a nap. lie down right here. there's a blanket in here. i used it earlier myself. dreamt i could breathe underwater like jacques cousteau. no one will know. i'll wake you up. and when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Pam: i think... you're a witch.
Other: i think you're amazing. you know that, right? go on, say it: ???i'm amazing.???
Pam: [drowsily] i'm amazing. [sighs]
Other: erin, i think you're making a big mistake right now. andy is a nice boy.
Erin: really? 'cause you've been kind of a b to him all afternoon.
Other: i was protecting you because i thought he was no good. but i can tell you really like him. and he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with europe on the brink--
Erin: irene, what would you do without me?
Other: we're not your concern, sweetheart. besides, glenn's going to sue home depot.
Erin: why?
Other: he got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
Other: jim, time for your review.
Jim: no, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Other: why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? wouldn't you rather come talk with me? maybe definitely get a raise?
Jim: yeah, that's the thing. i don't know if you can even give raises.
Other: jim, have you ever heard of a character named tinkerbell?
Jim: yes.
Other: i'm tinkerbell.
Jim: no.
Other: mm-hm. i'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Other: and we are grateful.
Other: but here's the thing about tinkerbell, jim. everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
Jim: she dies.
Other: she dies! now who here believes in tinkerbell?
Jim: let's see it. show of hands.
Kevin: i do. [applause] come on everyone...
Jim: all right, guys, stop.
Other: i already spent the money.
Jim: how?
Kevin: come on jim, you're killing her!
Other: we believe! we believe!
Other: look at this wonderful recognition of nellie's leadership. i believe. [applause continues]
Andy: that did not go how i wanted it to. ugh. i have a whole ton of erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] it's biodegradable. animals will eat it.
Erin: andy wait! [running down street] andy! andy wait! don't go! andy i love you! stop! oh, this is the wrong prius. i don't love you. i???m sorry.
Andy: erin!
Erin: andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Erin: let's get out of here.
Andy: okay.
Erin: let's go.
Andy: wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Erin: no, i don't have any stuff.
Andy: like your toothbrush and stuff.
Erin: i don't have one.
Andy: you don't have a toothbrush?
Erin: no.
Andy: how do you not have a toothbrush?
Erin: i just... there's always one around.
Andy: you just use whichever one is sitting there?
Erin: i always find one. have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Andy: of course. i own my toothbrush.
Other: i grew up poor. i had little formal education. no real skills. i don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. and yet, i walked right into a job for which i was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and i got it. if you ask me, that's the american dream right there. anything can happen to anyone. it's just random.
Pam: hey jim. stanley's back from the hospital today. can you sign his card?
Jim: oh, great. [reads] 'glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' oh that's not good.
Phyllis: oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
Pam: it's nice. it's funny. it mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Jim: stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Pam: yeah he does.
Oscar: pam, hit the brakes. stanley does not have a moustache. i misspoke. i'm not sure. i think he has one, now that- i think he has a moustache.
Pam: okay, phyllis sits across from him every day. phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Phyllis: oh, i don't know. now i think he doesn't.
Pam: phyllis! what are you talking- the whole card depends on this!
Jim: okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. how can none of us picture his face?
Angela: cause we come here to do our jobs. we don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Pam: okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of stanley with and without a moustache]
Dwight: neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. that said, the one on the left.
Other: [bell dings] guys, that's the elevator. what if it's him?
Jim: okay, quick. who says moustache? [pam, oscar, dwight, and creed raise their hands]
Dwight: yep.
Jim: who says no moustache? [jim, angela, and phyllis raise their hands; gabe enters, hiding stanley's face]
Other: [reveals stanley's moustache] ah! ha ha ha!
Phyllis: he does have a moustache.
Dwight: yes!
Pam: welcome back, stanley. [stanley grunts]
Other: good morning, robert,' says no one because our receptionist is in florida. [no one responds] pam!
Pam: oh! [takes out earbuds]
Other: is this a video conference you're having with 'drake, featuring swizz beatz'?
Pam: um, no, i was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
Other: people, you should come to work already warm. nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
Other: sorry, sorry, everyone, i'm late! but you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
Other: [laughing] nellie, really, nine fifty?
Other: oh, here's what happened. seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. i hear it. whack the snooze.
Other: ah.
Other: nine minutes. bzz! off it goes again. whack! seven more times i did that. bzz, whack. bzz, whack! by the time i got up, it was ten minutes ago. no willpower. that is my curse!
Other: [laughs] i've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
Other: ah ha!
Other: i don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
Other: oh, i assure you, i would have done. i did, and i will keep doing it.
Other: no, no, no, no. there's something going on. some stress in your life.
Other: well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to scranton nonsense. thirty boxes arrived yesterday from england and two trunks from florida. then i have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, god knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and i mean, no offense but are there a lot of irish people living around here?
Other: [in unison] yes.
Other: ugh! i hate that! no offense.
Kevin: none taken.
Oscar: actually, nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Other: oh! ay, carumba! the natives are getting restless!
Other: who's a native?
Other: uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. i would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Oscar: what does that mean?
Dwight: okay, okay.
Other: if you'd let me finish- or the squash court, or the supreme court. hmm?
Other: nellie?
Other: yes, robert!
Other: you're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
Other: yeah.
Other: let's help her out, shall we? go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm scranton hospitality. jim. dwight. take the day. help nellie move those boxes into her new place.
Dwight: why jim?
Other: the rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
Pam: i'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
Jim: i???m sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Pam: i'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
Jim: why is she here?
Andy: [sings] two crazy kids on the journey of life.
Erin: [sings] going to pennsylvania.
Andy: on the road with my new girlfriend. but first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern pennsylvania.
Erin: oh. that must be nice.
Andy: mm-hmm. it's a beautiful place. great place to let her down easy.
Erin: oh, no, no, i meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Andy: oh. hmm.
Andy: [sings] time to have a little kiss!
Erin: no.
Andy: mm. sorry. right. no kisses till the breakup is official.
Erin: yes.
Andy: i believe in that.
Erin: yes. so do i.
Andy: i think that's important. that is important. bummer, but important.
Erin: important.
Andy: mm-hmm.
Phyllis: i can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Pam: i know, right?
Oscar: she's always late, she's always rude...
Phyllis: it kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Oscar: yeah.
Phyllis: on purpose.
Pam: phyllis!
Angela: [laughs] we should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
Phyllis: order carrot cake. [laughter]
Andy: ...and jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for erin than anything wrong with you.
Erin: well, andy, i'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and i knew you as a lover and i'll remember you as a gentleman. okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Andy: consider it nailed.
Erin: [vocalizing]  i think we should try again. this time, worst case scenario.
Andy: okay, here we go. jessica, i'm really sorry. i just need you to know-
Erin: [whining] what?
Andy: i just need you to know-
Erin: what is it? i didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Dwight: [lifting box] ugh! ow.
Jim: nellie, that reminds me. do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'cause to be honest, i don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Dwight: don't listen to jim. have you ever seen him play tetris? 'oh, i think i'll just use this line horizontally. oh, i had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Jim: that was one time-
Dwight: i will get the chair in. watch the great schrutini work his magic.
Other: oh, no. really? magic? no, no, no. let's not go there. no, nothing is more repellant than magicians. bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. magicians are repulsive. next topic.
Jim: [cell phone rings] excuse me, one second. hi.
Pam: hey, what's up?
Jim: ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with dwight.
Dwight: [shouting] haulin' cube!
Jim: that's moving boxes. we just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Pam: so we're planning this party for nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
Jim: sounds like every other party.
Pam: no. we're gonna make it like a prank. like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
Jim: oh! hire a magician.
Pam: what?
Jim: trust me.
Pam: [laughs] okay.
Andy: wow. there's a lot of cars here. this is just weird.
Other: [knocks on car window] andy! hey, what are you doing here?
Andy: hey, lauren. look at you.
Other: well, i know. look at me.
Andy: i was just on my way back from this business trip, thought i'd stop and say hi to jessica.
Other: aww! [clicks tongue]
Andy: why is erin with me? that's a great question. she is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
Other: oh. god.
Erin: so, i'm erin. hi.
Andy: yep. this is erin.
Other: nice to meet you. [erin gasps at another girl outside her window] well, jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. hey ladies, andy's here!
Erin: okay andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. should we go?
Andy: yeah. uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, i think we should probably just-
Other: oh, jess! [claps] look who stopped by after his business trip!
Other: andy! hey!
Dwight: i wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in england. i really should have a tweeter account.
Jim: yes, you should.
Dwight: [finds shoe box] ooh.
Jim: [reads] 'nellie, don't open, stupid. love, nellie.'
Dwight: i have to see these shoes.
Jim: i doubt that they're sh-
Dwight: oh!
Jim: whoa. who is this guy?
Dwight: here's the two of them taking a hike. i'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Jim: boyfriend.
Dwight: here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the eiffel tower. i'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Jim: like a boyfriend?
Dwight: you read my mind.
Jim: yeah. whoa. here's one with his face whited out.
Dwight: hmm. maybe someone threw a pie in his face. new theory- he's a hated italian politician.
Jim: better theory. this is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Other: [walks in] oh.
Jim: oh, nellie. i'm so sorry. we were just...
Other: i see you've discovered benjamin. that's what i call my box full of photos of henry.
Dwight: why not call...
Jim: shh!
Other: god. we owned this flat together. then one morning, just like that, he was gone. he ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
Dwight: that's awful. what kind of restaurant.
Jim: dwight!
Other: i couldn't afford the flat myself. so i sold it at a loss. ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
Jim: i'm so sorry. these must be very painful memories.
Dwight: if it would help you to forget, i could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Other: thank you. no. look, jim, dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
Jim: no, no. of course. just one quick question. was this um, halloween, or...
Other: god, no. that's the most embarrassing thing of all this. what kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
Jim: [in the phone] you know what, pam? i was thinking maybe we should change course here. let's give up on all this mean stuff.
Pam: what? no! no, i just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. you don't have a copyright on pranks. i might be better at this than you.
Jim: no, that's not what i-
Other: jim, could you give us a hand?
Jim: absolutely. yeah. [whispers] call it off, pam. call it off, okay? it's way more complicated than you think. cancel the magician. trust me.
Pam: oh, okay. okay, i will. [hangs up phone]
Angela: pam, we have a great idea.
Oscar: listen to this.
Angela: we're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. it's gonna make everyone sick.
Pam: or what if...
Angela: okay.
Pam: we discuss... [angela and phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. like, not mean. just a regular party. [giggling stops] not mean.
Angela: i knew she'd crack! i wanted to leave you out, you know.
Oscar: we're in far too deep. we can't change course at this point.
Pam: what are you talking about? yes we can.
Oscar: what i mean to say is we don't want to.
Phyllis: toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Other: [pops balloon] suck it! [cheers, applause]
Erin: andy-
Andy: it'll be fine. just act natural. do you want a gummy penis?
Erin: no, uh, i'll just have some gummy bears.
Andy: these are delicious.
Erin: but... they're penises.
Other: and we come to matthew. the guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. [party guests groan]
Andy: ew! aww! that seems gross at first blush, right? but relationships are always more complicated than you think. i mean, we don't know matthew's history with this other woman. maybe she saved his life. [laughs] i don't know.  i just- i don't think we should rush to judgment about matthew. maybe we don't pop that one.
Other: no, pop it. pop it! [lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer]
Other: hey.
Andy: hey.
Other: sorry. it's kind of a madhouse.
Other: [grabs andy] ahh!
Andy: oh! ah, megan.
Other: you are one of the good ones, nard dog.
Andy: aww.
Other: no, really. [to jessica] where's my andy?
Other: i dunno.
Andy: oh, he's out there.
Other: aww. are you going to sing for us?
Andy: well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
Other: that's not like you. that's not like you. come on, sing! sing!
Andy: [singing] by yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
Pam: okay, they're almost here- what? come on. if you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of nellie]
Darryl: oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. andy was jelly roll. mike was dennis the menace. ryan was douche bag.
Ryan: hey, that's not a code name. that's just an insult.
Oscar: plus everyone would know who you meant.
Ryan: yeah!
Pam: no, that's a great idea. let's have a code name. how about mondays? i hate mondays? mondays are the worst?
Angela: nobody's named monday.
Ryan: hey, how about we go with pam? simple, easy to remember.
Pam: cause there's someone already here named pam.
Kevin: shh, here she comes!
Other: hey!
Phyllis: welcome to your party.
Other: everybody get comfy now. this first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Other: best gig ever. they asked me to play only originals. i said, 'have you heard my originals? they're terrible.' they said, 'even better.' i said, 'i get it. it's an ironic party for nellie.'
Erin: maybe we should just go.
Andy: no. i gotta do this. hey jessica, could i talk to you?
Other: uh, yeah, sure. what's up?
Andy: uh, maybe we could talk in private?
Other: uh, yeah. what is it?
Andy: well, first just let me say that i hope when i'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
Other: you're breaking up with me?
Andy: uh, no. no. you always do this. you twist my words around. part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
Other: oh my god. are you leaving me for erin? you said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
Andy: whoa! that? no. okay. you want honesty? super-honesty time. i'm gay.
Other: what?
Andy: i am gay, and i prefer men.
Other: i knew it!
Andy: you did not, kenny!
Other: you invited me to go shopping with you.
Andy: i like hanging out with you. you're a cool guy. which proves my point. that i'm gay.
Other: andy, you're not gay. i mean, we were... together. and you seemed pretty excitable.
Andy: well, i was faking it. i had to fake it every time. i had to imagine that i was in a steam room with john stamos.
Other: i can't say it doesn't make sense...
Andy: well... i mean, i was good at hiding it, but-
Other: look, it's fine, andy. i didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. i just... i'm just upset for now.
Andy: understandable. and i'm really sorry. i really am. [hugs jessica, grunts] so... we should probably... go.
Other: this humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. excellent.
Oscar: to nellie bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Other: cheers.
Other: why thank you.
Oscar: pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
Other: cheers.
Angela: nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day i imagine how happy i'd be if pam died. [laughter]
Jim: oh. well. i feel that as someone who knows pam only a little bit... enough. a good amount. not the most, though. i would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Other: we hate pam. we hate pam.
Other: we hate pam! we hate pam!
Other: so we've established-
Jim: no. no.
Other: -that you guys hate pam. do you ever wish she would just... disappear? [sets off flash paper]
Pam: oh! [laughter, murmuring]
Erin: that was a really rough scene.
Andy: right? rough scene.
Erin: yeah.
Andy: oh... at least we can kiss now.
Erin: oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]
Andy: you know, that stuff that i said about you to her... i did- that's just- i had to say it. you know, i was dating her at the time.
Erin: yeah. yes, of course. ah... i feel really tired.
Andy: yeah.
Erin: probably from seeing that turkey.
Andy: oh yeah.
Erin: when we drove by the farm. oh. always does it.
Other: are you nellie? oh, i think you're my volunteer. come on over here, huh?
Jim: oh, i'll do it. i will volunteer.
Other: no, nellie, she-
Jim: i'll do it.
Other: oh! big guy, huh? how's the air up there? watch out for... birds. [chuckles] all right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. now, what i want you to do is... i want you to pick a card just by looking at it. do not say what it is.
Jim: [picks a card] it's the four of hearts.
Other: oh, no, you-
Other: looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? no hablo el cardo, senor? hmm? ha. all right, the card is picked. now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [jim drops the cards] you didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?
Other: [to dwight] why is jim treating the magician poorly?
Other: little known fact about me. before i was a magician, i used to work at a rope factory.
Jim: not true. 'cause that's not a real place.
Other: but i never could seem to figure out those knots.
Pam: that's not a real knot. when you pull on it, it disappears.
Other: [yells] what the hell? all right, where's phyllis? who's phyllis? look. this is really uncool, okay? i put on a clean show here-
Dwight: okay scram, wizard.
Other: what?
Dwight: you heard me!
Other: huh!
Other: well nellie, i'm sorry. if i'd known jim and pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
Other: well, i thought it was quite fun. in fact, i think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. don't you see what i see?
Other: interesting. yes. no, yes, i see that. great work, team. great party.
Kevin: you think this is a great party? this cake has vegetables in it. like a salad bar, robert. how do i get this taste out of my mouth?
Erin: what? why are we-
Andy: i just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Other: oh. hello. hey everybody, look who's here.
Other: what are you doing here?
Andy: hi. super-duper honesty time. i'm not gay. in fact, i'm so not gay, i'm in love with a girl. her name is erin hannon and she's right there. she's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
Other: why the hell did you come back here?
Other: go away.
Other: get lost!
Other: get out!
Andy: okay.
Other: you're done!
Andy: bye guys.
Other: get out! you ruined my party! who does that? are you kidding me? [andy and erin run to the car] yeah, run away!
Other: you're disgusting!
Other: i can't believe you're not gay! [andy and erin kiss]
Other: yeah get out of here.
Other: don't come back. [someone throws food at the car]
Erin: uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]
Other: you don't even know how to drive! bye andy! loser! nice car!
Pam: hey hank.
Other: yes ma'am.
Pam: i thought i was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Other: yes ma'am. i got my eyes open.
Jim: well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Other: what? that ain't right.
Pam: yeah, he came and went.
Other: wait a minute! you said it was a magician, right? [pam nods] you don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...
Pam: let's just- let's go.
Jim: night-night.
Phyllis: whoo! wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. holy moley.
Jim: phyllis says the same twelve clich??s every time it rains. so, i promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, i will send out for hot chocolates.
Darryl: so how was the drive in?
Phyllis: oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Darryl: you don't say?
Phyllis: yeah. you know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Phyllis: oh, the plants are gonna love this.
Oscar: yeah.
Phyllis: i actually sleep better when it's raining.
Other: tell me about it.
Oscar: time's almost up. how many are left?
Pam: just one. 'this weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Darryl: phyllis. this rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Phyllis: what do you mean?
Pam: you know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Jim: hey, come on.
Phyllis: lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Jim: and that's noon. exactly. [others groan]
Phyllis: i mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. but everybody's being so nice to me today.  i'm really happy being here.
Andy: [singing] my girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
Other: hey la, hey la...
Andy: ...my girlfriend's back!
Erin: [simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Andy: anyway, i know it's the end of the day. we just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Kevin: welcome home.
Erin: thank you.
Andy: hey, kev.
Kevin: yeah.
Andy: nice sweater.
Kevin: [wearing a cornell sweater] thank you. nellie was nice enough to give it to me. she's sweet. i just wish there was pockets.
Andy: what happened to old salty?
Dwight: nellie let me bobble-ize him. his name is now captain mutato.
Dwight: i've written quite a bit of x-men fan fiction. captain mutato is half man, half mermaid. so he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. most of my writing involves the latter.
Andy: okey dokey. [knocks on door]
Other: yes?
Andy: whoa. well, you must be the famous nellie bertram i've been hearing all about. i am the famous andy bernard you've been hearing all about.
Other: oh yes.
Andy: i just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Other: you are most welcome.
Andy: anyway, now that i'm back, i would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Other: no.
Andy: obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. but, you know, the sooner the better.
Other: mm-hmm.
Andy: get back to normalcy.
Other: hmm, no.
Other: ...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. and then after jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. [pam, jim and kelly laugh] but if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.
Pam: oh my gosh, thank you so much. but seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
Jim: that's it.
Kelly: it's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Pam: ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and i said i know the perfect girl.
Jim: yep. because kelly is indian and... oh, that's it.
Pam: race had nothing to do with it. i just knew they'd be good together.
Pam: [talks over flashbacks] kelly has been a handful in the past.
Kelly: [cries, slams fist on desk] why?
Pam: [ryan and kelly make out in the nook] but she's had a bad influence. she's like an addict. [ryan and kelly argue] and i just had to get her clean.
Kevin: [ryan and kelly make out on oscar's desk] get lower.
Ryan: um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Jim: sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do not shake the baby.
Ryan: don't shake the baby. um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. and you got to, um, you can't do that.
Pam: don't shake our baby?
Ryan: yeah.
Pam: okay. i'd never heard that before. so, thank you.
Ryan: oh, my god.
Pam: yeah, i'm glad you said something.
Ryan: me too.
Ryan: kelly and i broke up and she can do whatever she wants. and her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into indian people. i'm not.
Ryan: hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? he's really into kelly, huh?
Pam: yeah, they're really great together.
Ryan: maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. i'd rather she be alone than with somebody. is that love?
Jim: that's about it, yeah.
Other: nellie! you've been terrific in your interim capacity. but, andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
Other: no.
Other: i'm sorry?
Andy: this is what i was trying to tell you.
Other: i'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
Other: well, bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Other: you're both adults. i'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
Other: i never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. so i find it best to excuse myself temporarily until i've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. buffett operates the same way.
Other: i'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, i'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Andy: [chuckling] okay.
Other: five... four...
Andy: you can't dock my pay-
Other: angela! dock andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Angela: on it!
Andy: great. five, four, three, two, one. angela, please dock nellie's pay a hundred dollars. angela?
Other: do you want to go again?
Andy: angela?
Other: let's go again. five... four...
Andy: ooh, she's counting again.
Other: three... two... one...
Andy: oh, oh!
Other: angela, two hundred dollars!
Angela: you got it.
Andy: seriously, angela?
Andy: i got a little bit of an anger problem. got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Erin: when i see him start to get mad, i just put my hand on his arm like this.
Other: i know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [andy laughs] five... four...
Andy: you're just saying numbers. it's meaningless.
Other: three...
Andy: it's literally like-
Other: two... [andy runs out of the room] one.
Erin: there you go. [helps andy in the car] hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Erin: hey. so last night was so not a big deal.
Andy: oh, yeah, i was just tired.
Erin: we both were. plus, i was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Andy: whoa. no. are you kidding? you were so sexy. just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. it just didn't last night.
Erin: really. it's not a big deal.
Andy: yeah. i know it's not... a big deal.
Ryan: i found this the other day while i was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Kelly: oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
Ryan: yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Kelly: god i don't even remember what that fight was about.
Ryan: you were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. but all i remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, i can send you the link.
Ryan: i'm in love with kelly kapoor. and i don't know how i'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but i do know that right here, right now, all i can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. again, that could change.
Erin: when you lost the manager job-
Dwight: yes?
Erin: did it affect you outside of the office?
Dwight: how?
Erin: i don't know what the technical term is... penial softiosis?
Dwight: erin, i am so glad that you trusted me. you came to the exact right person for this. no, i have never once experienced anything remotely like that. never.
Erin: oh, okay.
Dwight: okay?
Erin: okay.
Dwight: washington monument.
Erin: oh.
Dwight: eiffel tower.
Erin: okay, okay.
Pam: i saw you were getting along with ryan again.
Kelly: he's so sweet. he pointed to my latte and he said, 'kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Pam: yeah, he's so great. remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
Kelly: which time?
Pam: i am not going to let kelly throw her life away on ryan. and it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. why you would even ask or were going to ask, because i- i felt like that question was coming.
Dwight: one of toby's eyes is getting smaller. so there's that. gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and meredith said she was interested and then gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. so i'll keep you posted on that.
Dwight: every day i brief nellie on what's going on in the office. most of it's irrelevant. but a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Dwight: oh, and andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
Other: what do you mean?
Dwight: erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. by contrast, i went to sleep with an erection so large it was like i was wearing no blanket at all. wow, i knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! i'm a little bit jealous, actually. reduced him to a mere ant.
Other: i just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Other: okay, i would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
Andy: you can't call a meeting. [laughs] but i would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! so let's get in the conference room. thank you. good. thank you for coming to my meeting.
Other: okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Andy: oh! can't do it 'cause i gotta run a meeting. so.
Other: no.
Andy: wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Other: andrew, not everyone here is important. and the word is 'impotence.'
Other: which is important in its own way. so if you'd just like to take a seat, andy.
Other: take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' margaret thatcher said that... probably. don't know. don't read. didn't see the movie.
Other: this meeting is not about any one person in particular. it is a human problem.
Dwight: it's not just a human problem. flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Oscar: nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Other: oh, oh, it's not me. no, no. i've never had any problem in that arena. and i have been with several older men.
Other: [in unison] how old?
Other: jinx. buy me some coke.
Other: dwight told me about it earlier.
Erin: dwight!
Other: what?
Erin: you promised!
Kevin: dwight couldn't get it up for nellie?
Dwight: no, no, no, no, no, it's not me. i'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Angela: what are you doing?
Oscar: what is this?
Angela: stop that! dwight! stop that, stop it.
Andy: fine, it was me. i couldn't- i had a problem with erin last night. happy?
Andy: i had a lot on my mind last night. and i didn't perform. okay? it happens to plenty of guys. it's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Andy: every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. tuna? t-dog?
Jim: um...
Darryl: uh... i have other issues. i'm terrible at math. overweight. you- you're in great shape. a lot better shape than i am, tell you what.
Other: it seems andy is the only one with this problem. fascinating.
Andy: fascinating.
Other: i don't really see what the problem is. erin doesn't even like sex, remember? you said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
Other: chumbo, come on, help me out. any problems with little chumbo?
Kevin: tip-top shape.
Other: oh... stanley?
Other: no. um-um.
Other: creed, you are a thousand years old.
Other: haven't heard any complaints. wouldn't care if i did.
Andy: okay, so i-
Pam: actually andy, i think maybe we experienced it.
Jim: what happened?
Pam: that a couple of times-
Jim: couple of times.
Other: jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
Dwight: yeah jim.
Andy: yeah jim, get it out there.
Jim: um... i don't... uh, yes, that time that it was very late. uh, we'd had sex so many times already, i was exhausted...
Pam: okay, stop.
Jim: i was very drunk.
Phyllis: if it makes you feel any better, i never had an orgasm until i was forty-two. and then when i did, it lasted 'til i was forty-four.
Phyllis: forty-three was ju- i got nothing done. [laughs]
Other: i've read- and i don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
Angela: ugh.
Other: this is just, uh- this american life, i think i heard it on.
Other: no, that's absolutely the case.
Other: i know, right?
Dwight: you know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but i could let you rent it.
Other: andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [creed, kevin and meredith raise their hands]
Kevin: ooh, ooh!
Jim: wow, what are we talking about?
Erin: toby, doesn't hr have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Toby: erin, hr is a joke. i can't do anything about anything.
Other: the most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. and that's a vicious spiral.
Other: i almost didn't come in today. [laughs]
Andy: [on the phone] dad, don't think of it as a demotion. just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. i don't think you have to tell your friends anything. it hasn't been decided yet.
Other: erin, on phone memos you're writing the date american style. month, day, year. i prefer it day, month, year. small, bigger, biggest. oh, sexual innuendo. not intentional.
Erin: shut up. shut up! i am sick of your dumb opinions. and if you don't like the way that i take phone messages, here! [throws phone] take 'em yourself!
Andy: oh, and another thing! our sex life is none of your businesses!
Erin: and andy is the manager, not nellie!
Andy: stop protecting me! i'm a man- i can protect myself! this is misdirected anger and i'm sorry! i don't mean to lash out at you! there's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] dad go to hell, i'm taller than you!
Other: okay, just calm down.
Andy: you are not the manager. i earned that job. i was personally chosen after robert was chosen and quit.
Other: andy, why don't you just take a seat?
Andy: why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
Erin: and why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Andy: and your stupid face! [grabs nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] and your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] ah!
Darryl: he does not like that wall.
Erin: maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Andy: that would actually be cool. i'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Other: andy, erin, you can join us now.
Ryan: hey, i hear you been bad-mouthing me to kelly.
Pam: all i did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Ryan: well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. if you have something bad to say to me, pam, say it to my face.
Pam: fair enough. um... i don't think you're a very good person. and forgive me, but i feel like i've said this to you before: i don't like you very much.
Ryan: well a lot of people would say that i'm a better match for kelly than ravi is.
Oscar: oh come on, ryan. really? ravi's way better.
Ryan: for kelly?
Kevin: yeah. man, you're insane right now. ravi's the whole package.
Other: i've never met ravi personally, but i'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, brian, that i prefer ravi. and again, i've never even met the guy.
Ryan: kelly, i wrote you the most amazing love poem. but i can't even read it. my heart couldn't handle it.
Pam: oh, no, no, no.
Oscar: oh, come on.
Pam: read it, please. i love amazing poetry.
Ryan: no. it would cause me too much pain.
Pam: read through the pain. be strong.
Ryan: this poem would crush you!
Oscar: ryan, go away! she found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Kevin: yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! please leave her alone.
Ryan: you see, kelly? our love scares them. it screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Kelly: ravi makes me incredibly happy. and ryan puts me through so much drama. so i guess i just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Other: andy, we're going to go with nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. i promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. i already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]
Andy: no.
Other: excuse me?
Andy: i'm saying no.
Other: well you can't say no.
Andy: no.
Pam: [sees ryan on the horse] oh, boo! boo! boo to you! boo!
Ryan: you are toxic! you are toxic!
Pam: boo!
Jim: hey, hey. okay.
Ryan: kelly, i have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Kelly: i wasn't going to interrupt.
Ryan: well you do a lot, so just don't. thank you. i know that i haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. but i want to marry you, kelly kapoor. maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Pam: barf! ugh, you suck!
Ryan: what is your problem? [to horse wrangler] hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? this is very important to me.
Other: turn around. turn around. turn around!
Ryan: can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? thank you.
Other: she don't wanna turn around.
Ryan: thank you. kelly, i can't promise you that we'll always stay together. i can't promise you that i'll never cheat on you. nor should i. modern marriages aren't built that way. men aren't built that way. there's a very interesting article i can email to you. but i can tell you this. even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, i wanna roll those dice. i love you, kelly.
Kelly: ryan.
Ryan: will you roll those dice with me?
Kelly: you mean so much to me. but, i love ravi and i choose him.
Ryan: no you don't.
Kelly: i do.
Ryan: no you don't.
Kelly: i hope we can still be friends. can i have a hug?
Ryan: what? [they hug]
Kelly: that was really cool. [they make out]
Angela: ugh. eww!
Jim: well, it's good to see kelly's maturing.
Angela: oh god!
Other: look, andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.
Andy: no.
Other: it's the apology. i really have to insist.
Andy: [british accent] no.
Other: stop saying no.
Andy: no.
Other: andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. so... is there anything else you wanna say?
Andy: no.
Andy: i can't describe it. i just, for the first time in a long time, i actually feel in control. i feel... alive.
Erin: here- [grabs the box andy's holding]
Andy: ah- da, da, da, da. i got it.
Erin: but you hurt your hand.
Andy: i... got... it.
Erin: right now?
Andy: yes.
Pam: you're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from ryan's soul?
Jim: not at all, can we go?
Pam: kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.'
Jim: second line.
Pam: he is a drifter out to sea.'
Jim: and when the indian ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and kelly green.'
Pam: it's just so dumb. [chokes up] but when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Jim: uh, ryan can never know.
Ryan: [pacing back and forth.] no, no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no, no, no.
Pam: okay fine. ryan, something the matter?
Ryan: smokey's dead.
Pam: smokey, the bear?
Ryan: smokey robinson pam. he died like an hour ago, i guess i'm the first to know.
Jim: wow that's terrible, i really liked him.
Ryan: oh you liked him? that's nice. did you like when he changed the course of american music like two or three times? did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? i'm glad you liked him jim. i am completely devastated right now.
Jim: well, i second that emotion.
Ryan: huh?
Other: i know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Ryan: oh god, nellie! what wasn't his? i mean, um, 'tracks of my tears'?
Other: yeah
Ryan: um... god, so many, nellie!
Pam: no, no, no, 'tracks of my tears' and what else? what are some more? what's one more?
Ryan: okay, i'm not... i'm not playing this game, pam. not today.
Pam: i don't think you love smokey robinson. i think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Ryan: okay, i'm sorry i'm not a fan of jason mraz or the beatles.
Dwight: you don't like the beatles?
Ryan: that's... that's not the point!
Dwight: eleanor rigby? paperback writer?
Ryan: okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. what was i so busy doing?
Oscar: it says here this smokey robinson dead thing was a hoax. it's on cnn as of two minutes ago.
Ryan: okay well, that's a relief!
Jim: wow! look at that! it says he's actually playing state college. that's only three hours away!
Pam: oh my god, ryan! that's perfect! you have to go!
Jim: tickets are 250 bucks.
Pam: 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest smokey robinson fan.
Ryan: yeah... who's opening?
Jim: paul anka.
Ryan: paul anka?! how can they make the smoke man play with someone like that? i don't think i can see this.
Jim: okay, you could just show up late though.
Ryan: how much is parking, like 30 bucks? that's not what smokey would have wanted. does want.
Pam: tears of a clown!
Ryan: don't call me a clown, pam. you're better than that!
Darryl: looking good, rc!
Other: ugh, i hate ties! i feel like i'm being strangled like i'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on i-84. the red room say? or dominick's?
Angela: robert! the senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... i'm sure it will be fine.
Angela: my husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! robert california bought two tables for everyone here! these people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Dwight: i don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Jim: well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Oscar: what's going on?
Dwight: there is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Erin: oh that's andy. he's just hanging out
Dwight: that's how workplace tragedies always begin. a middle aged white male 'hanging out'. call the cops!
Pam: dwight, i don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Phyllis: how do you? i mean, why do you think he's there?
Dwight: i don't even know what kind of weapon he has. could be a knife, could be a gun. could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. i'm going up to the roof. [grabs bag.] and i'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
Other: i knew this would happen! everybody told me if i moved to america, i'd be murdered.
Andy: hey!
Erin: hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Angela: we think you might kill robert.
Andy: what?
Kevin: because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Andy: guys, everything is fine! i'm just here to pick up erin. we're going to the fundraiser.
Pam: oh, great! that sounds good!
Kevin: wait, what? you're going to the fundraiser tonight? that's going to be weird.
Andy: why would that be weird?
Kevin: it's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Erin: andy's just coming as my date.
Kevin: hey, i hear you! i hope you're right. it just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Other: [hears knocks on door.] come in!
Darryl: you really re-did andy's office, huh?
Other: yes, cut out the clutter. very simple, very minimal.
Darryl: i need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Other: how are things in the warehouse?
Darryl: you could go downstairs and ask them?
Other: the warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] is it? is it?
Darryl: who knew, right?
Other: [speechless.] i...
Other: tonight could be the night that darryl and i go from casual work friends to actual good friends. the only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Angela: robert, the senator and i wanted to stop by and say hello.
Andy: hello! did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Kevin: oh man, this is weird!
Other: andrew. [robert extends his hand.]
Andy: oh, wanna shake my hand, huh? cause i want to shake your body! [hugs robert and laughs.] i had you, i had you!
Andy: [points back and forth at the multiple cameras] where do i look? it's been so long since i did one of these things? okay, alright! what's the question? how am i doing? umm... great!
Kevin: creed, i just bid twenty dollars on six jiu-jitsu lessons. no one's raping this guy!
Other: well, i don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] twenty-two!
Kevin: no! it was my idea to not be raped!
Dwight: [dwight enters] wait, you think jiu-jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] if you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Kevin: whoa, dwight, i don't think you understand.
Dwight: you guess the price, you win the prize. have you never been to a quaker fair before? god!
Kevin: so dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. i guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? up till now, we didn't have one!
Andy: what haven't i been doing? gosh, just today i was working on this rock opera that i'm writing, though it feels more like i'm receiving it than writing it.
Jim: wow, that's exciting! but until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Andy: the hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. and he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Pam: sounds like you're doing alright.
Andy: ehh, a little better than alright, actually. really good!
Ryan: oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Other: you know, oscar, i really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
Oscar: my dog gerald is my life.
Other: really? well, if you want to get involved, call me. this is my cell. i'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... excuse me. [walks away.]
Oscar: this confirms three things: i'm right about the senator, i still got it, and poor angela.
Other: [telling story to nellie.] i stepped in right away and start--
Andy: bobby! bobbo! you're a rock opera guy, right? you like rock operas?
Other: well...
Andy: you gotta check out this thing i'm working on, it's really cool. there's this character thomas oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Other: so, thomas oregon is an evil figure?
Andy: evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Other: and the hero, who's that based on?
Andy: me, i guess. [sings.] we're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and i!
Other: hey jabroni. show some class.
Other: she's right, andy. you're being a jabroni
Andy: you're being a thomas oregon!
Other: andrew, i think this may have been a bad idea. why don't you let me pay for you and erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
Andy: don't need you to pay for me. i'm doing just fine, thank you. why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Other: andy you should leave. now.
Andy: [to waiter.] excuse me. i would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Other: i'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
Andy: then i'll take a table!
Other: okay
Andy: and a high five! [raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] oh, let's do this again!
Andy: [waiter is cracking pepper into andys salad] oh, yes indeed... when! [waiter begins walking away.] whoa, whoa, whoa! you forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] when!
Oscar: i stumbled into a very dramatic situation. angelas husband just hit on me!
Pam: oh my god!
Oscar: i know!
Jim: wait, what? come on!
Oscar: we were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. he was just dying for me to have it.
Jim: okay, oscar, i'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Oscar: well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Jim: okay, what was this look? [oscar does the look.]
Pam: whoa!
Jim: what happened, did he do it?
Pam: are you-- twice! for real?
Jim: okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? life isn't downton abbey.
Pam: life is downton abbey.
Jim: here's what i'm going to do. i'm going to go over there and i'm going to talk to him and i guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Dwight: [on phone.] how much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? thank you!
Dwight: it's $475! like candy from a baby!
Andy: hey... david wallace!
Other: andy bernard!
Andy: hey, how are you?
Other: how you doing, i'm great! how you doing, are you still with dunder mifflin?
Andy: no, got canned last week.
Other: oh, i'm sorry to hear that.
Andy: no, best thing that ever happened to me.
Other: that's the attitude to have. you know what, when i got canned, i was lost, right? i poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called suck-it.
Andy: yikes!
Other: yeah, exactly right? then suddenly out of nowhere, the us military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! the point is, forget those guys, k? move on! good to see you, andy!
Other: call me a lame man, but i wish there was some real food here. you know, like hamburgers... or oreos... or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Darryl: tacos.
Other: what i wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Darryl: i can go get us some tacos.
Other: brilliant!
Darryl: if you loan me some money.
Other: yes, i can do that. for, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? or $25? $20?
Darryl: $30.00 
Other: $30, yes!
Other: i've never eaten a taco. i'm not entirely sure what they are. as long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Oscar: [jim shakes senators hand, returns to table.] so?
Jim: boom! [hands oscar a business card.]
Oscar: this is interesting.
Pam: hm-hmm.
Jim: what is interesting? i just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Pam: or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Oscar: he does not think jim's gay. a gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Pam: well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Jim: oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
Other: before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. robert california!
Other: thank you. why do we love dogs? want me to tell you why? there is no answer. our love for them confounds reason!
Andy: can you believe this guy?
Other: the state senator, robert lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if i loved dogs. you know what i said? yes! [laughter.]
Andy: not a joke. that was not even a joke.
Other: bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. but people don't often adopt older dogs, so bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
Andy: i will! i will take all of those dogs!
Other: andy, that's very kind--
Andy: no, no, no. this guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
Other: andy why don't we discuss this at a--
Andy: no, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. hello everyone, i am andy bernard and i am going to take that bitch home! that is a female dog reference. [points at himself] this bitch understands loyalty! sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, i will take bella and every single one of her friends!
Erin: oh god!
Other: mr. bernard, right this way.
Andy: okay! hope you all learned something!
Other: huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. you can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. so, other end is best. don't split up daisy and mojo because daisy will start to, uh... i was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.
Andy: i'm so ready to love all of these animals. this one's even bonding with me already.
Other: uh, no. kenny's a therapy dog. he apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.
Andy: stupid dog.
Other: well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! so here's my office number, and my cell number.
Other: thank you!
Pam: well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm sorry oscar.
Oscar: sorry about what? there's nothing to be sorry about here.
Oscar: no. i'm certainly not disappointed that angelas husband was not hitting on me. i'd have to be a monster to root for that. a lonely, aging monster.
Darryl: tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
Other: oh, great! okay, oh... oh, these tacos!
Darryl: hmhmm.
Other: mmm! uhh [eats taco incorrectly.] mmmm... oh! hmmph!
Darryl: she's trying.
Other: the winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is dwight schrute!
Dwight: [applause] yes! thank you!
Other: the yearlong membership to scraton-bikram yoga is dwight schrute!
Dwight: [applause] oh yes! yeah!
Other: a one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to dwight schrute!
Dwight: [applause] oh, oh, oh! yeah! ha, ha!
Other: well, i think i can save us some time, dwight schrute has won every single item here!
Dwight: thank you very much! all i had to do was look at the prices, idiots! suck it!
Other: well, dwight, yes! you certainly are a record breaker! your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]
Jim: speech! speech! speech! speech!
Dwight: thank you. wow, i can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... and obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. but, i want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! how many courses did we have tonight, two? three maybe, if you choose the pudding? i mean what waste! these tables tarted up like victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. he's what's important, whatever his name is. not any of this. so that is going to be my donation to you. thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Other: oscar!
Oscar: nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Other: it was lovely! and don't forget to call.
Oscar: okay
Other: thanks so much for coming
Oscar: why does this always happen to me? ahh! i just feel so bad for angela
Andy: [applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Other: that's right!
Andy: ugh, oh god!
Other: yeah, you never get used to that.
Jim: hey, just wanted to check in. see how you are doing.
Andy: i am so great!
Erin: he's great. we're all great. twelve dogs. this my life now, i'm a dog nurse.
Jim: look at that one though, he's smiling!
Other: yeah, he should be! it's his first day without a muzzle.
Andy: this is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
Pam: absolutely, it's awesome--
Jim: yes--
Kevin: i'm sorry, are you guys nuts? he's not doing great! he was fired! this is terrible! this is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
Andy: you're right. he's right, i am a mess. this whole night i've been trying to convince you guys that i'm fine. i guess i thought that if i could convince you that i'm fine, maybe--
Other: maybe you would think it too! [silence.] i'm sorry, it's just i don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.
Jim: okay well, andy, listen. it's okay if you don't feel totally settled. this is all very fresh.
Pam: yeah, i mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
Andy: yes! and also, focusing on the positive. like i got a lot of good things going on!
Jim: yeah! like that rock opera! you could always do that right?
Andy: yeah, i do. i have that.
Jim: yeah
Erin: you're going to be alright
Kevin: no. no he's not.
Andy: yes, i am! thank you, kev!
Kevin: you're welcome!
Kevin: sometimes i feel like every one i work with is an idiot. and by sometimes i mean all times. all the times. every of the times!
Erin: so some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. it's been great!
Darryl: pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Kevin: my dog ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! she's so chill.
Pam: what do you feed her?
Kevin: well i put out pro bow-wow, but she barely touches it. she's so dainty!
Darryl: is she sick? how are her poops?
Kevin: doesn't really poop. it's perfect, nothing to pick up! she just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. i put on the tv for her, but i have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Pam: does she smell?
Kevin: she smells horrible. it's unbelievable. but i don't want to put her in the bath, because i'm afraid that she'll drown.
Kevin: people seem awful interested in you ruby. guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks kevins face.] yeah, that a girl, that a girl! man that stinks!
Other: ugh, man. my delts are blasted. i wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Dwight: protein powder, huh? you cut it with water? why don???t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] there you go boys. see how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] mwah.
Other: i remember when people thought biceps were all that. they???d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Dwight: oh, i bet you think it???s all about core, huh?
Other: yeah.
Dwight: oh, please.
Other: core???s critical. there are four tenets of pilates that i live my life by. one ??? lengthen. two ??? elongate.
Jim: listen, guys, i think we all want to know the same thing, right? who???s the strongest? well, there???s only one way to solve that ??? flat curl contest.
Jim: all right, here we go everybody. may the manliest man win. go.
Dwight: feast on this, lewis.
Other: i love the burn. the burn is where i live.
Jim: come on, gabe, you can???t handle his hamstrings. you???re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Other: speed set. one. two.
Jim: here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Dwight: oh, thank you.

Other: five. six.
Jim: quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Other: eight, nine, ten.
Other: we got it?
Dwight: very funny jim.
Other: yeah, jim. way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Other: everyone, conference room, now. [dwight and gabe stand up, falling over]
Jim: all right, easy there, grandpa.
Dwight: i don???t need your help.
Jim: okay. you don???t need my help?
Dwight: here, here??? just???
Andy: morning.
Erin: hey.
Andy: somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot??? these.
Erin: oh.
Andy: you know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that i am going to prepare for everyone.
Erin: andy, if you???re gonna hang out for a while, uh???
Andy: what???s this?
Erin: this dumb rule robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Andy: is this robert???s attempt to embarrass me?
Erin: no, of course not. it???s just ??? i think it???s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it???s like, where does it end? so just??? [puts visitors tag on andy]
Andy: why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they???re rewarded for it, and when i do it, i am told it???s a little much? ???is it because i am not an employee anymore, because that???s what it feels like.
Jim: all right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Dwight: good, we have a deal?
Jim: thanks janet.
Dwight: thanks so much earl.
Jim: wow, simultaneous sale.
Dwight: and they said it couldn???t be done. boom!
Jim: screw ???em.
Andy: lot going on guys. what???s happening?
Jim: binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy: that was a fine branch. things are really bad under robert california, i guess. it???s like a festival of poo.
Jim: hey, hey, come on, language.
Dwight: yeah, and we???re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Jim: in the fridge.
Dwight: no, jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim: sorry, man, i can???t focus on zingers. there???s too many potential clients.
Other: you two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis: yeah, the syracuse branch can???t be happy you???re taking new york clients.
Other: shh??? shh??? [vomits in trash can]
Jim: robert?
Oscar: why did binghamton close?
Other: can everyone just, please??? i had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. i got into a case of australian reds, and ??? how should i say this ??? columbian whites. what ??? what is this about, uh, binghamton?
Kevin: the branch closed. forever.
Other: closing the binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. or, i guess, last night. but, in vino veritas as they say, i???m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
Other: i got your voicemail. from ??? from last night.
Other: wonderful.
Other: and the answer??? is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Other: pam, when???s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn???t hold the memories in?
Pam: oh, it was this summer ???
Other: apparently, i left a phone message for nellie last night, and i need you to find out what i said.
Pam: um, i am a little busy.
Other: yes, ???course. why don???t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Pam: yeah, i can make you a list.
Other: let???s do it now. what???s number one?
Pam: why don???t i help you now?
Other: there we go.
Pam: okay.
Other: who the hell are jim halpert and dwight schrute?
Erin: jim, dwight, what are your last names?
Dwight: and you are???
Other: harry jannerone, dunder mifflin syracuse.
Other: what the hell???s all this?
Andy: uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Other: you live well down here in p.a. i want to talk to you guys right now. oh, and lloyd gross too. which one???s that guy?
Jim: the salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight: lloyd gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ??? how do i put this ??? steal from the company. embezzle. to commit fraud.
Jim: okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight: yes.
Jim: pam made a drawing of lloyd. he is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Dwight: [pointing at toby] there he is. that???s lloyd.
Toby: me?
Other: yeah, you.
Other: where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby: now, we???re actually a lot closer to binghamton than you are. kimosabe.
Toby: i like to think lloyd gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn???t back down from anybody. and he calls people ???kimosabe???.
Other: they???re new york. we???re new york. sate line is the dividing line. that???s the way it???s always been.
Jim: there???s actually not a rule that says that.
Dwight: that???s true.
Toby: that???s true. there???s no rule. you can check the employee handbook. oh, can i check the employee handbook lloyd? well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Toby: no.
Dwight: wait, no? are you kidding me? you told me there was a rule. i could???ve choked so many people by now.
Other: stay out of my state. it???s in your best interest to stay out of my state.
Toby: i???ve seen guys like you. big guys who like to push the little guys around. lloyd gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Other: just stay out of new york, lloyd.
Toby: hey, text from the old wife. gonna take that. [runs outside]
Jim: how about this? how about we just ask robert? can we all agree that maybe the c.e.o should decide this?
Other: robert???s here. look at us. bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. i don???t think we were doing that.
Dwight: chair, lamp, plant, table leg, jim???s leg.
Other: where???s the advil, jim? i think i???ve hit my limit on the tylenol ??? oh.
Andy: [doing dishes] sorry, not jim.
Other: andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? hire you back and send erin back to florida?
Andy: message received loud and clear. just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Other: oh, for god ???
Other: robert california. what a surprise you???re here in scranton.
Other: harry???
Other: so why would you close binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Other: how do you mean?
Andy: i forgot, a??? a pan, uh ???
Other: no, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
Other: harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. there???s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems??? so poorly timed.
Dwight: okay, what are you deciding? we get a say.
Other: listen, robert, i don???t have time. there???s a big client in play. prestige direct mail solutions ???
Dwight: don???t listen to him.
Other: used to be binghamton???s ???
Dwight: nope.
Other: i want it, it???s mine.
Dwight: prestige is ours. okay, they???re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. we get them. we already put a call into them, robert.
Other: we need you to make a decision.
Dwight: make a decision.
Other: i have decided. neither of you are to have any contact with either prestige or any other binghamton client until i have figured out how to divide things up. as solomon once said??? [andy walks out]
Andy: some bizarre energy in this place today. robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. like why is nobody gonna call on prestige? that is a huge client. [walking to car] i mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. could be any idiot. any idiot at all.
Other: shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. you have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. the two must harmonize. are they still there? [camera pans to right, harry, dwight, and jim watching robert in conference room] they want a decision who gets the big client. well, they can wait. i???ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. you know, i trained as one.
Other: is it just me or is our boss a freakin??? weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] i???m gonna get some air.
Dwight: jim, you know what would be really dastardly? if we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Jim: [gets up and looks out nellie???s office window] he???s running!
Dwight: damn it!
Jim: damn it.
Dwight: wha ??? what is this supposed to be?
Jim: it???s a monkey.
Dwight: jim, great real. this is not a monkey. it???s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Jim: hold on, hold on. is this him?
Dwight: what?
Jim: is that him?
Dwight: it???s him! do something! get out!
Jim: what? what am i gonna do? i don???t ???
Dwight: go slash his tires! go dent his hood. [jim opens passenger door] that???s it? oh, that???s great. that???s like a five second delay.
Jim: dwight!
Dwight: come on, let???s go! does this thing have turbo? nitrous? hit the nos.
Jim: nos? you mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight: yeah.
Jim: oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Dwight: hit the nos.
Jim: are you sure?
Dwight: yes.
Jim: brace yourself. 3??? 2???
Dwight: got it. go.
Jim: 1. here we go! [turns on wipers]
Andy: hello. andy bernard to see the c.e.o.
Other: oh, do you have an appointment?
Andy: no, i do not.
Other: okay, i think i can squeeze you in.
Andy: seriously? ???cause i could just be anyone. i mean, i thought i was gonna have to convince you.
Other: he???s really not that busy.
Other: is there someone here to see me?
Other: yes, this man.
Other: come on in. [andy walks in]
Pam: so???what do you make of this robert california guy? i mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Other: oh. oh, i???ll tell you what he does.
Angela: : [walks in] hello! hello, my clucking hens. got room for another in the roost? huh? don???t worry, i won???t lay an egg.
Angela: : robert sent me to take over if pam fails. if? [laughs]
Angela: : i have been crunching numbers all day. math is for boys. i need girl talk.
Other: did someone say girl talk?
Other: sometimes i wonder if i have ovaries in my scrotum, because i am great at girl talk.
Other: have you guys been watching any good korean soap operas? i???m pretty deep into hee-jungcinderella girl. although, i definitely fast-forward through the young-tae storylines.
Other: do you think i???d like that, or is it important to have an asian fetish?
Other: uh, i think you???re gonna need to have an asian fetish. yeah. [chuckles] it???ll be upsetting if you don???t.
Andy: i???m a former paper executive. i know the product. i know the margins. i can save you 25% on your costs.
Other: why haven???t i heard of you? you got any references?
Andy: no. i???m a rogue.
Other: uh-huh.
Andy: which is the best part. that means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. now??? [pulls out business card] i have written down my personal phone number. you call this anytime.
Other: every salesman i???ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Andy: of course they have. which is why i???m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to c.e.o] whatever you need ??? anytime, night or day ??? you just stop on by.
Other: you want me to drive to your house if i need paper.
Andy: maybe you just want someone to talk to. maybe??? you need a place to crash for a couple of days. my wireless password is eat pray love. easy to remember.
Dwight: ready? go! go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Dwight: [running] ahhh! [slides into elevator]
Jim: you all right?
Dwight: yeah. [doors about to close, hand stops them] oh.
Jim: ah! [harry walks in]
Jim: [dwight pushes button for floor two] dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight: go, go! take the stairs! now!
Jim: what are you talking about?
Dwight: just run! take the stairs!
Jim: i don???t even know where the stairs are!
Dwight: i???ll stall him. go!
Jim: god!
Other: [dwight jumping] what are you doing?
Dwight: i???m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. we???ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] oh. [jim runs in] my pants fell down.
Jim: what?
Dwight: my pants fell down! i don???t have a belt!
Dwight: [walks into lobby] hello, sir. good day. dwight k. schrute. dunder mifflin, scranton. forgive my pants, they fell down. an appointment with mr. ramish, please. right now is fine. no, no, no, i was here first. dwight k. schrute. dunder mifflin, scranton.
Other: what???s going on?
Dwight: well ???
Other: mr. ramish, harry jannerone. dunder mifflin, syracuse ???
Dwight: i was here first.
Other: oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
Dwight: i already made an appointment??? with your secretary.
Other: let me stop you all right here. i???ve already picked a new paper supplier.
Dwight: wait, it???s not d.m utica, is it?
Other: no, no, it???s not dunder mifflin at all actually. it???s??? big red paper company.
Jim: big red paper company?
Other: mm-hmm.
Andy: yes, yes, yes!
Other: give me a cup of coffee.
Dwight: me too. or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Jim: all right, guys. it didn???t work out for any of us, so??? we???re still on the same team. let me get these.
Dwight: no. let him get his own. it???s syracuse money.
Other: you know, your partner???s got a lotta attitude. but i like that. how long you guys been dating?
Dwight: jim couldn???t land me in a thousand years.
Jim: but you???re saying there???s a chance.
Dwight: shut up.
Pam: [walks into conference room] hey.
Other: hmm.
Pam: i stole nellie???s phone.
Other: excellent. excellent. though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam: what do you want from me?
Other: now we get to the bottom of nellie???s ???yes, yes, yes, yes, never.???
Other: hi, nell, it???s mom. do keep your chin up. it can???t be as bad as you described.
Other: oh yes it can.
Other: this is mastercard. you are over the limit. send the minimum payment of $448 by monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
Other: shopaholic.
Pam: sounds like it.
Other: yeah.
Other: hi, sis. is your boss still hitting on you?
Other: ah.
Other: this is annie from second nests. i???m sorry, but the romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we???re gonna hold out for that.
Pam: okay, that???s enough. [grabs phone]
Other: pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Pam: no, no, no!
Other: no, come on.
Pam: robert! okay, oops! i deleted them all. they???re all deleted.
Other: pam, pam, you???ve completely bungled this!
Pam: ah. ahh. [walks out]
Pam: hey.
Other: can i do it, pam? can i put off a gold arabian sandal?
Pam: um??? yes. definitely. with your hair ???
Other: oh!
Pam: certainly. um??? you dropped your cell phone.
Other: oh, gosh.
Pam: yep.
Other: thank you. i???m??? so stupid.
Pam: no. my goodness. you have a lot going on. with robert and everything.
Other: oh, god, pam. don???t get me started.
Pam: no, i will not.
Other: you???ve just got me started. robert??? is??? a filthy beast. i mean, don???t you get the feeling, he???s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Pam: well ???
Other: i mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Pam: but sometimes he talks about flesh??? and bacchanals.
Other: i cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Pam: no??? don???t. just put it out of your mind.
Other: pam, what is your address? i???m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. oh, no. you don???t ???
Other: oh yes. come on, a little gold arabian slipper.
Other: things are looking up. i might be a mother soon. i have mastercard right where i want them. and??? i have a new friend. a friend. at work.
Other: [erin opens door] erin.
Erin: there???s a call for you on line one.
Other: who is it?
Erin: he says salvation. no last name.
Other: yeah, hello?
Andy: [in car] you once put me on a list of the losers in the office. well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. so hire me back, that business is yours. don???t, and i will find another buyer.
Other: you???re blackmailing me.
Andy: it???s just business.
Other: ah, well, i will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. you wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. you???re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. you don???t even know my real name. i???m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
Andy: whoa. well i gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
Other: [opens door] andy bernard.
Andy: you got a minute?
Other: um??? i???m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Andy: i wanted to see if i could interest you in an investment. dunder mifflin.
Other: dunder mifflin. [closes door] now??? why would i want that? it???s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Andy: exactly. and you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
Other: why don???t you come in? [andy walks in, closes door]
Other: so what would you do if you weren???t selling paper?
Jim: oh, man, i???d have to sell beets. probably submit them for competitions.
Dwight: what?
Jim: yeah! i know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Dwight: how have we never talked about this before? wait. you don???t even care about nationals.
Other: nothing?
Jim: i don???t know. i???ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Other: i???d like to sell one big thing, you know? like??? a plane. one sale, i???m out.
Jim: that sounds lovely.
Other: anyway, robert???s gonna run this company into the ground, so??? we won???t be doing this in six months.
Oscar: [to webcam] hello. my name's oscar. i'm an accountant in scranton, pennsylvania and i'm gay. and i'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. when i was younger, um-
Phyllis: what's he doing?
Dwight: he's searching out younger gays.
Phyllis: oh.
Oscar: no, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Dwight: ...with you. [chuckles]
Oscar: no matter how hard it gets for you, eh- kelly, seriously, i-
Kelly: just keep chatting. i'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Oscar: do you not own a mirror?
Kelly: webcams make me look the way i do in my fantasies.
Pam: i know, right? what is it? you always look so good in those things.
Kelly: i'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Oscar: okay, as you can see, i now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Other: no, i'm sorry, i just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of america misled by some reductionist-
Oscar: it's not misleading.
Other: -pep talk. sexuality is a spectrum. it's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as 'normal.' it gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
Kevin: hey, robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [robert backs into kevin's nose] ooh! [whimpers]
Other: ow! damn it, kevin! god!
Dwight: you okay, robert?
Other: fine.
Dwight: put some ice on it.
Oscar: in any case, it gets better. [kevin cries] maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Other: one, two, three!
Dwight: i wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. at first i thought, 'muffin basket.' then i thought, 'what???s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Other: can you just smile, please?
Other: i don't want to!
Dwight: ...their own children.
Dwight: hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. darryl. we'd love to see little jada come by. angela? why don't you bring by your little angel?
Angela: no thank you.
Dwight: jim, you've got those two cute kids. we sure would love to see them.
Jim: i know why you're doing this, dwight.
Jim: last week, i may have gone too far. i'll explain it quickly. basically, i found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away velcro. and... you can fill in the rest.
Dwight: [jim rips off his clothes] wha-? [stanley laughs] damn it, jim!
Jim: now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. i think it's fair to be cautious.
Darryl: let me get this straight. you lost all of it. all your winnings. a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Other: bad economy. bad investment.
Darryl: you mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for asian homosexuals?
Other: they did not.
Darryl: and you got half a million of these? well i gotta try it.
Other: i wouldn't.
Darryl: aw, come on. what's the harm? [makes face] mmm. what flavor was that?
Other: coconut penis.
Darryl: the coconut's pretty subtle.
Other: come on, man. can't you just give us a yes or a no?
Darryl: i don't know, man. y'all quit with a lot of confidence. i mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees brandon] oh.
Darryl: if i were val, i would break up with brandon. then i would date the hell out of me. i wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. but when i finally did give in, i would go crazy on myself.
Andy: [wearing janitor outfit] hi guys.
Jim: how's it going, man?
Andy: [whimpering] i'm- i'm good, thank you. and how are you?
Jim: great, yeah, good.
Other: oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
Other: oh god.
Andy: look, i'm not here to get my old job back. i had my opportunity, i blew it, i'm moving on. i just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. i will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Other: no, you don't understand-
Andy: clean the toilets.
Other: i don't need anyone to-
Andy: pull the poop out of the toilets.
Other: that's not even a thing.
Andy: just, please...
Other: andy.
Andy: please!
Other: andy.
Andy: give me something!
Other: why don't you clean the carpets for today?
Andy: thank you.
Other: you're welcome. up you get then. pick yourself up. there it is.
Andy: thank you.
Other: you don't need to-
Andy: i have a delicious secret.
Other: good, good. this carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Jim: is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Andy: yeah, it is actually.
Andy: mmm, i can't hold it in any longer. um, i am faking this, okay? because i convinced david wallace to buy dunder mifflin back from sabre. and at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Pam: [enters with the kids] family picture!
Jim: pam? no!
Pam: what? honey, we talked about this.
Jim: no, we talked about not bringing them in to dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Pam: yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Jim: no, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Pam: no, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
Jim: nope.
Pam: we decided that there's no way dwight would harm a child.
Jim: but are you a hundred percent sure? i don't think any of us are.
Pam: no, no.
Jim: nope.
Pam: but it's free. and we'll keep our eye on them.
Jim: that's-
Pam: yes!
Jim: that's-
Pam: and we'll make sure dwight doesn't do anything c-r-a-z-y.
Jim: okay.
Kevin: wait, c-r-a-z...
Dwight: great, right up there.
Pam: yeah?
Jim: yeah. you just sit right here. here we go.
Pam: okay.
Jim: alright. why don't you just-
Pam: oh, great. thank you.
Jim: #name?
Pam: okay.
Jim: this is great.
Pam: you ready?
Jim: excuse me.
Pam: there we go.
Jim: just do it.
Pam: i'll just stand here?
Jim: yeah, just keep your eye on dwight, great.
Other: sir, could you look into the camera?
Jim: let's do it, shoot it.
Other: sir.
Jim: great.
Dwight: up here. [whistles]
Jim: yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dwight: jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] okay, good.
Jim: oh, so that's it?
Dwight: that's it.
Pam: see? that wasn't so hard.
Dwight: cute kids, thanks for coming.
Other: hello, erin. hello, everybody.
Angela: uh, what? why? uh, hi honey. what- how are you doing?
Other: hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. and if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op.
Phyllis: [laughs] yeah.
Angela: heh.
Erin: okay, you're going to go through the hallway. here's a map. and if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Other: thanks.
Dwight: well, well, well. senator lipton, welcome. angela.
Angela: dwight.
Dwight: nice to see you. may i hold him?
Other: sure.
Angela: no. i am going to hold him because i haven't seen him all day.
Angela: i think that dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's dna to prove he's the father. which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man i've ever been with.
Angela: [phillip cries] see the duckie!
Dwight: okay, hold on for a second, folks. a few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Other: oh, thank you.
Angela: [slaps dwight's hand away] no. no. i like the baby's hair the way it is.
Dwight: really?
Andy: this is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] it's go time.
Andy: hey nellie, i made soup - i made you some soup.
Other: well, i don't want any soup.
Andy: but it's really good- [drops soup] oh!
Other: oh come on, andy!
Erin: i know this is going to be a great payoff.
Andy: a delicious moment.
Erin: but after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Andy: well, but it-
Erin: just calibrate. okay? calibrate.
Dwight: okay, here we go. oh, you know what? i don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but i want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Angela: uh-uh, leave us alone.
Other: i guess we're okay with the fingernails.
Dwight: okay, great. suit yourself. although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
Angela: dwight, we're fine!
Other: oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?
Angela: oh no. [laughs]
Other: i'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
Dwight: he defecated, aw.
Other: you're stinky.
Darryl: a lot has changed since y'all left, okay? you're gonna have to jump through some hoops. and the new foreman is here. now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? so i need you to show her your upmost respect. make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? can you do that?
Other: that's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. i don't even talk to her like that.
Other: uh, brandon?
Darryl: i would.
Other: you would?
Darryl: yeah.
Other: sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.
Other: calm down, he's not.
Darryl: yes, i am. just so everyone's on the same page.
Other: [scoffs] so you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
Other: brandon!
Darryl: good slam.
Other: thank you, biggie.
Darryl: good luck to you.
Other: oh, and have a burger for me.
Other: okay, shall we take a few more?
Angela: i think we have all the shots we need. thank you, dwight.
Other: okay. there we go.
Angela: no! dwight! give me the diaper! dwight!
Dwight: is this what you were looking for? huh? huh?
Toby: andy, we wanted to talk to you. a lot of us are very concerned about you.
Other: you're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
Andy: i just want you guys not to worry. 'cause old andy's gonna be just fine.
Jim: no, no, see? this is what we're talking about. i mean, what was that accent? and last time i checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Erin: no, unfortunately it's true. he's been a nightmare. and the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
Other: what?
Pam: you hit her?
Andy: no. that is not the deal. calibrate.
Erin: he's not hitting me. but, he's been verbally abusing me-
Andy: that's not true either! that's also total- everyone, please relax. i think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
Other: [enters] happy birthday to gabe!
Other: oh, get out, skeleton man!
Toby: i can refer you to someone to talk to.
Andy: [his phone rings] huh? hold on.
Toby: give you a name or-
Andy: i just gonna- quick- [answers phone] hello? hey, what's the scoop? are you close? what? no. no, no, no, no, no. you have to come now. traffic clears? no, next friday... that's not gonna work. okay. yeah. okay. [inhales, hangs up] damn it! well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as i wanted, but i do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. not only am i not a lowly janitor, i am the regional manager once again! guys, i got my old job back!
Jim: oh boy.
Pam: oh, andy.
Oscar: what?
Andy: i'm not crazy. i convinced david wallace to give me my job back.
Oscar: david wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Andy: okay, yes, i see the confusion. i saw david at the fundraiser. he is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'suck it' to the u.s. military.
Jim: andy, come on.
Kevin: even i know that's weird.
Andy: i- i- okay, i get how that sounds crazy.
Toby: hey, andy, nobody's calling you crazy, andy. we're your friends, andy.
Andy: stop saying my name.
Erin: no, he's not making this up.
Andy: thank you, erin.
Erin: andy tells me about seeing david wallace all the time.
Pam: but have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Erin: oh my god.
Andy: erin, come- come on. you know i've been talking to david wallace.
Toby: do you see david wallace in the room right now?
Dwight: [into phone] operation phoenix is a go. just get the car ready.
Kelly: now you look at me like you're adoring me, i'm gonna look at the camera like i don't even know you're there.
Other: i do adore you.
Other: andrew, it's time for you to go home. you're better than this.
Andy: yeah, i know.
Other: everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing i have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] why'd they add coconut? i miss original.
Jim: hey.
Other: hey!
Other: hey guys, long time.
Pam: david, what are you doing here?
Phyllis: is it true you're buying the company?
Other: okay, i guess the word is out. uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, i've been talking with andy-
Andy: what? thought i heard my name. what? i'm the new manager?
Other: i'll get to that in a second, andy.
Andy: but it's- it is- it is me? right?
Other: yes, as we've discussed-
Andy: what?
Other: but it's very possible-
Andy: oh my god!
Other: probable.
Andy: wow. from janitor to manager?
Other: yep.
Andy: that's quite a cinderella story. from m-o-p to m-v-p.
Other: there's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Andy: from total loss to total boss, i mean-
Other: can we expect any payroll interruptions?
Other: now that is a great question, stanley. right now i think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in florida, so to shift back up-
Andy: i was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as i thought it would.
Phyllis: so we're not gonna be a part of sabre anymore?
Other: actually, nothing is gonna be a part of sabre anymore. jo bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Other: oof. [laughs] wouldn't wanna be a sabre employee right about now. [laughs] i'm actually the ceo.
Other: ah, i didn't realize you were standing there.
Other: hey, my friend, trust me. this is for the best. i never understood that corporate mess.
Other: well, okay. great to meet you.
Other: likewise, i'm bob. bob kazamakis.
Other: pleasure.
Other: i'd love to give you a little rundown on what i've learned about this place.
Other: that's very gracious of you, bob. i would love that.
Other: please. [laughs]
Andy: guess i'd better take off these dirty rags. figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Jim: perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Andy: gosh, i hope so.
Angela: no! god, mose! god!
Other: hi, angela.
Angela: get out of the car! get out! where is he?
Other: i'm not supposed to say.
Angela: yes! [slaps mose] tell me! tell me where he is! mose, damn it! where did he go? mose! get back here!
Darryl: [taking photo with jada] let's see that smile. go on. [waves to val]
Other: [stands next to him] right here?
Darryl: cool.
Andy: looks like i might get my delicious moment after all.
Other: may i say one thing?
Andy: it would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
Other: the quality of mercy is not strained.
Andy: no.
Other: it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Andy: do not bring shakespeare into this. how dare you play the bard card?
Other: it blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Andy: i just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. is that too much to ask?
Andy: if i were to hire you back. if. what do you think you would do well?
Other: special projects manager, that's my background. i just go around doing whatever i want.
Andy: all right, you sly bastard. when can you start?
Other: okay everyone. i had a conversation with bob, and since i am going to be ceo now there'll be no need for him.
Other: ouch. that's gotta hurt!
Other: but, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Other: david has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. so, for the next three years, i'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some african, some asian, but mainly eastern european women.
Other: i had no idea how pervasive this problem was until bob explained it to me.
Other: oprah winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. i want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. they've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
Andy: gymnasts? you're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
Other: yeah, so i'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. well, andy, it's been fun.
Andy: mm. mm-hmm. [they hug, robert kisses him on the lips]
Other: it's been a great year.
Dwight: hello.
Angela: where is it?
Dwight: they're testing it now.
Angela: how long does it take to get the results?
Dwight: seventy-two hours.
Angela: you're gonna wait here?
Dwight: yes. [angela sits and holds his hand]
Angela: [dwight kisses her] dwight, i can't do this. dwight!
Other: hey.
Oscar: senator lipton. hey, how are you?
Other: you didn't call.
Oscar: um, well, uh, the issue that i- that concerned me...
Other: you know what this is about. [covers phillip's eyes] call.
Erin: andy???s coming back today! andy???s coming back today! ha! andy???s coming back today. david wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. he sent his own son too. and the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
Dwight: how was my summer? it was pretty mixed. i invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. mmm, mmm! so that???s really good. but i got some disappointing medical news.
Other: mr. schrute, the results are in. you are not the father.
Angela: i told you [dwight vomits power drink on angela]
Kevin: oh, what a summer! an emotional roller-coaster. i ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then i saved him by gluing his shell back together. but i???m not that good at puzzles.
Oscar: [as kevin reassembles shell] that piece doesn???t go there. [kevin shushes him]
Kevin: so i patched him with stuff from around the office. but i couldn???t get the pieces to fit right. then one day, when i was reaching for the glue, i crushed his shell again. but i rebuilt him even better that time. but it turned out the turtle was already day. probably when i ran over him the first time.
Pam: for us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
Jim: you are really good at modesty. she???s a genius.  she painted this incredible mural in the kids??? room. there???s a hippo leading a parade of 500 children???
Pam: kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
Jim: oh, yeah
Pam: yes, jim???s friend is starting anew company based on this idea jim had when they were back in college.
Jim: its sports marketing basically. but the athletes are partners.
Pam: and he wanted jim to be a part of it too.
Jim: in philly, so, that doesn???t really work for the family. watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Pam: he said if it takes off he???s gonna buy us a new car.
Jim: an altima or better.
Toby: kelly kapoor is gone. her fianc?? ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at miami university.
Kelly: [tossing out winter coats] i don???t need em anymore. i am going to miami biotches. to hang with lebron james and gloria estefan.
Toby: miami university in ohio. on her last day, kelly was still a little confused about it
Kelly: enjoy the snow losers.
Erin: i???m so happy for you kelly.
Toby: shortly after kelly left, ryan quit and also moved to ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
Ryan: i???ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern ohio is going to be the next silicon valley. they call it the silicon prairie. it???s a big university town. and, uh, that???s not garbage, it???s out clothes.
Pam: and that was our summer.
Jim: we good?
Other: yeah
Pam: don???t you guys have everything. i mean, its just a paper company.
Other: well we???re more following you guys, to see how you turn out.
Pam: oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. well i don???t think anything???s gonna change in our lives now. with work and two kids there???s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
Erin: andy???s coming back today!
Other: hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
Other: oh, my god. it???s called a garbage can.
Phyllis: helpless.
Toby: there???s two new guys back there with me now. they???re in their 20s. and we really get along.
Other: [playing computer game with toby] you???re looking good.
Toby: just three single guys. getting into trouble.
Other: they???re like the new jim and dwight.
Other: oh, yes, yes i see that! perfect.
Other: hey, new jim, come sit on my face.
Other: no thank you. my name???s pete.
Jim: no, pete is not the new jim. the only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on meredith???s face.  and if that  makes him the new jim, then every human being in the world is the new jim.
Erin: andy???s here! old dwight, new dwight, andy???s here. new jim, tuna, andy???s here. pam, he???s here. [squeals as andy walks in]
Andy: hey! wow, i thought about this place a lot when i was on solo. three days on a mountain, it???ll change you. the things we think we need. clocks, yeah right!
Other: it sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
Andy: what???re you still doing here?
Other: wonderful, thanks.
Andy: you know i had this really funny dream during outward bound that you died.
Other: brilliant.
Andy: see me in my office later. the new guys, alright. it???s clark and, um???
Other: pete!
Andy: in outward bound it was all about nicknames. they called me iceman. you will be called plop.
Other: what? why?
Andy: cause you???re always taking dumps.
Other: no i???m not.
Andy: come on, everybody defecates. relax, plop. and you will be called fart cause you fart all the time.
Other: i love it.
Darryl: actually, andy, we call this one dwight, jr.
Other: no, i prefer fart.
Andy: no, dwight jr. infinitely better. you guys look exactly alike. dwight go stand next to him. this is insane.
Dwight: i don???t see it.
Other: i don???t either.
Andy: whoa! mind blown. it???s like father and son! dwight, you cool if we call him dwight jr?
Dwight: yes, yes i am. [puts his arm around clark]
Andy: dwight, jr! [dwight gives clark a noogie]
Dwight: in a way it???s like i have a son. and who knows? maybe someday they???ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. and then i???ll have a grandson.
Angela: well, i need to give my cat up for adoption.
Kevin: the one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Kevin: angela???s cats are cute. so cute that you just want to eat them. but you can???t eat cats. you can???t eat cats, kevin.
Angela: no, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, comstock! ok, look [starts playing video on computer]. he???s such a special kitty. i just want to find him a good home. he loves those pants
Kevin: i???ll take him.
Angela: please, after the turtle?
Kevin: i am enormously proud of what i did for that turtle!
Angela: oscar, oscar, will you take him?
Oscar: no, i???m a dog person.
Angela: if you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
Oscar: those guys always change back, angela.
Andy: david, outward bound was incredible. i was the best at slack lining, i ate a worm.
Other: glad to hear it. you sound very confident and decisive.
Toby: hey you wanted to see me?
Andy: yeah, i gotta go david. [hangs up phone] why is nellie still here?
Toby: you can only fire nellie for cause.
Andy: mm, then i will make up a cause.
Toby: except you just told me you were gonna make it up. now if she sues, i have to testify against you.
Andy: then forget i just told you that.
Toby: can???t. i took a course at the weintraub memory academy. i sat next to this woman named beverly brook. she had a greek salad for lunch. see what i mean?
Andy: now i know why michael hated you so much.
Dwight: good boy, getting big and strong. snack foods!
Other: yep, body by cheez-it
Dwight: ah, humor. i have it too. i have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. you interested?
Other: i think i???m busy that night. or i would.
Dwight: well, we???re both just kinda learning as we go, aren???t we?
Other: learning what?
Dwight: just how this going to be, you know? you have a beautiful round head.
Other: kay.
Dwight: so what kind of farming you into, huh? you more of a fruit man or a root man?
Other: is this???is this like code for gay stuff? cause if so, that???s totally fine. like, i???m fine with it. but you should know that i???m into the ladies.
Dwight: spoken like a true root man.
Other: you know, if you???re ever swamped, i could make some sales calls for you.
Dwight: my calls?
Other: so could you give me a list of all your clients? or just the leads that you haven???t had time to pursue yet?
Dwight: you want a list of my clients? you want my leads?
Other: yeah, i???ll just give it a glance???
Dwight: ok
Other: i???ll give it a read.
Dwight: with my leads and stuff like that?
Other: yeah.
Dwight: cause you???re interested in going into sales?
Other: i am.
Dwight: wow, that???s great. that???s great. ok, good, let???s talk about that, ok?
Other: ok.
Dwight: you???re not getting my clients! nice try.
Dwight: paranoid? i???m not familiar with the word. and i really don???t have time to learn new words right now, ok? a pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
Dwight: jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
Jim: done. explain.
Dwight: the new guys. dwight jr is after  my job. yeah. there is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Jim: oh, now i get what pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
Dwight: wait, sales???what sales meeting?
Jim: the new guys called one.
Dwight: the new guys called a sales meeting?
Jim: clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. did you know there was a belt above black?
Dwight: there???s no belt above black. is there a belt above black?
Jim: you should ask him. it???s a color you would never expect. [dwight storms off] too easy.
Angela: attention everyone. comstock is still available. oscar has been flirting with adopting him. but still hasn???t given me a definite yes or no.
Oscar: definitely no.
Angela: fine. for any interested candidates, i will be conducting 20 minute interviews. my ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. black or white, i???m fine with either, but not both. [to pam] listen, you???re in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
Andy: i wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. it???s going to be terrible.
Other: not necessarily
Andy: no i???m going to make sure that it is. and if it isn???t, i???m going to take immediate action to rectify that. now, i don???t like to throw around the b-word, but i???m going to be a huge bitch to you.
Andy: now this is called slack lining.
Andy: i set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
Andy: if you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. but, if you toby out, then you???ll feel like a real nellie. how about a hand, screw those guys. now, these are my actual outward bound counselors, rafe and feather.
Other: iceman.
Andy: that???s me. the powder is for your protection, feather has permanent athlete???s foot. feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
Jim: you a sports fan?
Other: sure, boxing, tennis.
Jim: oh. any team sports?
Other: nascar. the amazing race.
Jim: phillies fan, though, right?
Other: you mean horses?
Jim: no, like baseball. a baseball team.
Other: ah, i like the red sox. i???m from vermont.
Jim: ok. good talk.
Jim: i have nothing in common with plop.
Andy: all right, who???s next? nellie?
Other: oh, i would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Andy: nonsense. get up here.
Kevin: go ahead
Andy: come on. uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
Other: i???m very self-conscious about my feet.
Andy: ok, sure. there ya go. atta girl. hey, alright. whoa! [pushes nellie off slack line] you suck. alright, who???s next? darryl?
Darryl: this seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
Andy: dwight jr? this looks like your speed.
Other: uh, i guess i could give it shot.
Andy: yeah, come on. get up here. just hop on up.
Other: ok
Andy: focus on the horizon. [clark successfully walks the slack line] whoa! look at this guy.
Other: i???ve always been good at anything that required balance. my doctor says i have gigantic inner ears.
Darryl: go, dwight jr!
Andy: hey, yes.
Dwight: boo, unimpressed. it???s a tightrope for babies. boo!
Other: alright, let???s see you do it.
Andy: alright. let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
Andy: ooh! who ordered the hot apple fail?
Dwight: ok, i am just getting started, ok?
Other: you got this, it???s all you. [as dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] got ourselves a yard sale. balls in face. it???s not a race, dwight.
Andy: well it???s official. old dwight is lame and new dwight is cool.
Dwight: [bleeding heavily from the mouth] that???s not true.  just give me another chance.
Oscar: but your mouth is ble???
Toby: this is a bloodbath. alright, i???m calling this.
Dwight: what?
Toby: it is enough of this. everyone, let???s go back to work.
Dwight: this is a stupid activity. i would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] idiots.
Dwight: slack lining, please. untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. doesn???t seem so macho now, does it? it???s a jump rope!
Pam: dwight!
Dwight: pam? hey come up here, up the ladder. come on.
Pam: [sees trapeze contraption] what are you doing?
Dwight: come here, i???ll show you.
Angela: why do you want this cat?
Other: i don???t want it, really.
Angela: how would you support the cat? what are your ambitions?
Other: i want to start my own business. i want to be a millionaire. lots of things. travel, make the world a better place, earn an mba at night.
Angela: have you taken any concrete steps?
Other: well, i???m still just fitting in here, you know? getting used to the new job. but, definitely on the agenda. but that is a good idea, angela. i should make a list.
Jim: oh, come on, pete! god, that???s just sad. if he doesn???t watch himself, he???s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] wow, maybe pete is the new jim.
Dwight: do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? that means it???s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. so you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as i pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
Pam: i will?
Dwight: you will. yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn???t you say?
Pam: sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
Dwight: so you???ll do it?
Pam: no.
Dwight: come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
Pam: dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but i love my boring life.
Dwight: come on.
Pam: exactly the way it is.
Dwight: no, pam.
Pam: yes, and there???s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
Dwight: please? please, pam?
Pam: find someone else, i don???t know. ask phyllis.
Dwight: i can???t use phyllis. are you kidding me? the moment she steps off this bar i???ll be launched into space. god, you???re so insensitive.
Other: why are you getting rid of it?
Angela: allergies.
Other: your husband?
Angela: no, the baby. please, it???s my husband???s favorite cat. he???s broken up about it. it???s the only time i???ve seen him cry other than our wedding night.
Oscar: you know what? i will take comstock.
Angela: really? oh, oscar, thank you!
Oscar: i???ll come by after work and pick him up.
Angela: yay! oh, poor robert. he won???t get to say goodbye. he has this business dinner tonight
Oscar: c???est la vie.
Angela: please don???t teach the cat french.
Oscar: [on phone] yeah. good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy comstock.
Pam: you ready?
Jim: yeah. you know what? i???ll meet you down there. just gotta make a quick call.
Pam: kay.
Dwight: ok. [prepares bike trapeze]oh, god.
Dwight: attention, employees of dunder mifflin. everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. boo. hey clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. they say that you only live once and i???m about to prove it. dwight schrute!
Jim: hey, man. it???s halpert. did you go to the other guy yet? great, don???t. i???m in. yeah, yep, i???m all in. ok, talk to you soon. bye. [hangs up] yeah!
Dwight: woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] ahh!!
Other: in the parking lot today there was a circus. the copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. there was a dwight impersonator and a jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. i laughed and i cried. not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
Other: crap. sorry, nellie.
Other: once again, i understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would???[hit in the face with trash]
Other: mm, swish.
Other: oh, it???s nothing to do with me. i just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
Andy: there are two things that i am passionate about. recycling and revenge.
Other: [as trash is thrown at her] fluke.
Pam: [surveying an untidy office] the building???s custodian is on vacation for the month and dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. so, instead, we???re living in filth. but, not for long. because i have created the chore wheel.
Kevin: [viewing the chore wheel for the first time] oh, yeah! can i spin first?
Pam: well, it doesn???t spin. we???ll just move the wheel one notch each morning and??? you see what chore you get that day.
Kevin: a wheel is supposed to spin.
Erin: yeah, you know, like [motions arm in circles] guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh??? guh.
Pam: no, i???m familiar with spinning. it???s just that wouldn???t work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
Andy: [interrupting] bugh, boring. all she talks about is chores.
Other: a wheel wants to spin, pam.
Jim: [reluctantly] spinning would be more fun.
Pam: [frustrated] ???kay.
Kevin: [spinning a new ???chore wheel??? while everyone claps] okay, that???s what i???m talking about! big money, big money! [wheel stops on ???mug duty???, disappointed] mug duty?
Pam: yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
Kevin: this sucks.
Erin: yeah, seriously, it???s like everything on there is work.
Pam: i don???t think you guys understand why we???re doing this. it???s-
Kevin: yeah, i don???t think that you understand wheels.
Pam: i???ve been through several rounds of development with the team and here???s where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third ???chore wheel???, excited] we???ve got prizes! ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. like, no internet, stanley gets your lunch. the one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. but they were right; it???s more fun this way.
Pam: [everyone cheers as meredith spins and lands on ???tiny wheel???] the tiny wheel actually does have chores. it???s so cute no one seems to mind.
Pam: [referencing the ???tiny wheel???] toilets! [everyone cheers as meredith accepts her chore]
Jim: [at the halpert residence as cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] pam, we gotta go. cece, go back inside. grandma???s got breakfast, ok? [to camera] we are going to roy???s wedding. yep, roy. i think the only weird thing about going to your wife???s ex-fianc?????s wedding on a weekday at eight am is that it???s your wife???s ex-fianc??.
Pam: [exiting house] thanks, mom!
Jim: [to pam] a banana?
Pam: yeah. i???m afraid he???s only gonna have hot dogs.
Jim: oh, come on. not even roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Pam: planned a wedding with him. he wanted hot dogs.
Jim: [to camera] just??? so weird.
Erin: [as pete and clark enter office] oh, pete, you???ve got mail.
Other: really? i got something?
Erin: well, it???s addressed to customer service so, it???s your mail.
Other: well, you know, i???m also customer service.
Erin: yeah, i???m alternating. [gestures both men]
Other: [sarcastically] yay, another person yelling at me.
Erin: well, it could be a nice letter. i write nice letters to companies all the time.
Other: that???s really nice.
Other: [looking down at erin???s desk] wow, newsweek, huh? this election??? thing is crazy, right?
Other: [referring to the letter] it???s open.
Erin: oh yeah, i accidentally read it. it???s not a nice letter.
Other: [whispering] ok.
Other: [distributing paperwork to the office] get excited. the special projects fairy has arrived.
Other: i know you don???t really exist.
Other: today, i launch my big charity initiative ???operation give back???. andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. so, i???d like to see him piss on that one.
Other: [at roy???s wedding] darryl! ha-ha! what???s happening?
Darryl: congratulations, baby!
Other: ah, thank you!
Jim: [jim and pam approaching the wedding venue] is this his house?
Pam: think so.
Other: [approaching jim and pam] mimosa?
Pam: [taking glass] thank you.
Other: would you like me to take your peel?
Pam: [embarrassed] yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
Jim: ok.
Pam: [as jim receives and declines a call] who???s that?
Jim: uh, my ex-fianc??.
Pam: [sarcastically] ha-ha.
Jim: i started a new business with my college friend. but, pam doesn???t know. um??? actually i did tell pam and we decided ???no???. but, then i decided 'yes' anyway. so, i???m thinking there???s another conversation coming. and, it???s hard to know when that will be.
Other: with operation give back, you pick the charities dunder-mifflin supports.
Kevin: [grinning] oh boy! what's happening?
Other: there's four thousand dollars to give away. so, who has filled out their form? stanley?
Other: american diabetes association.
Angela: um, you have diabetes, stanley. [to nellie] i'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
Toby: i w-, uh, i would love to give uh-
Kevin: [excited] heifer's international. listen to this. they give a poor person like, a goat or something. it's a great prank.
Other: i wanna work with, uh, jimmy carter and help build gnomes.
Other: dwight, what about you?
Dwight: i will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Andy: uh, correction, i give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. changes lives.
Other: thank you, andy.
Andy: i'm not doing it for you. i'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
Other: dwight, you will be participating.
Dwight: no thank you.
Other: participation is mandatory; dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
Dwight: fine, i chose the global relief foundation.
Other: great, thank you.
Dwight: which was recently discovered to be a front for the taliban.
Other: [everyone groans] oh, for goodness' sake, dwight.
Dwight: yeah. the taliban in afa-ghanistan.
Other: the taliban is the worst. great heroine, though.
Other: dwight, i cannot have the taliban on the roster of operation give back.
Dwight: well, it looks like there won't be any operation give back. ha, ha. the nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. you're welcome. [wads up nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
Jim: [approaches roy back at the wedding] there he is. is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
Other: aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. it's, everyone's just been so nice.
Jim: thanks for inviting us, by the way-
Other: are you kidding?
Jim: that was, that was a surprise.
Other: come on. if it wasn't for you, i never would've met laura. i mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. [sees jim's reaction] just kidding.
Jim: you're welcome.
Other: thanks...aw.
Jim: by the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
Other: started a gravel company. i mean, who knew it'd take off?
Jim: gravel company?
Other: yeah. what about you? what are you doing?
Jim: not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] no, things are good. things are good. got some stuff in the works. so-
Other: oh, cool.
Jim: yeah, you never know.
Other: hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. [referring to jim] he's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. cheers.
Jim: ok, kenny.
Other: [talking on phone] duncan, listen, i would love to help you out but where am i gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? huh? hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] oh my gosh. you love the news, right?
Erin: well, it depends. i mean, sometimes i find out things that are really sad.
Other: well, i got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and i can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
Other: uh, is it duncan?
Other: he's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if i didn't get you on tape.
Erin: you mean, put me on the news?
Other: you'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. you know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. it'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with duncan... with my friend. [erin considers] what do you say? huh?
Erin: maybe, ok? let me think about it.
Other: [pete looks on disappointed] ok.
Erin: whoo!
Other: think it over. [punches pete]
Other: no, clark's not my friend. he is the douche that sits next to me at the office. my friends are scott, glenn, and rob. but, you don't know them.
Erin: i never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. but, why? because i happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? i mean, what if the ad had been for a ceo? or for a brain surgeon?
Other: so, ah, it was a year ago today that i met laura. i thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. you are full of surprises. you are my beautiful mystery girl. and, today, i have a surprise for you. [approaches piano]
Jim: he plays piano?
Pam: no. roy? no.
Other: you know how i said i was taking boxing lessons? actually, i was doing this. um, so, i hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano]
Darryl: [clapping] you got this, roy. [roy begins playing and singing she's got a way by billy joel, pam and jim looked shocked, phyllis and bob begin making out]
Pam: [in the car] we still surprise each other.
Jim: definitely.
Pam: you know, i never did it, but for your 30th birthday i really wanted to surprise you with-
Jim: courtside seats. sixers.
Pam: yes. but, what i didn't tell you is that i actually bought the tickets. we only didn't go because it was-
Jim: it was an away game.
Pam: in phoenix. they should really tell you that more specifically. i mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] do we know everything about each other?
Jim: no.
Pam: tell me one thing about you i don't know.
Jim: [laughs] um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]
Jim: [in the kitchen] oh, here's one. did i ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? and bought the winning numbers the next day? and then, played the tape for me the next week, and i-
Pam: and you thought you guys were millionaires.
Jim: you heard that one.
Pam: yes. but there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. i can't remember.
Jim: that i thought we were millionaires.
Pam: thought you were millionaires, yeah. that's funny. shoot, i knew that one.
Jim: that's all right.
Angela: the senator and i still have mystery. i'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [oscar chokes on his coffee]
Jim: you all right? [oscar nods]
Other: you support the taliban abroad. so i assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Dwight: anything else would be inconsistent.
Other: will you join me then in a pledge to live by taliban law in this office? [offers dwight a contract]
Dwight: [takes contract] absolutely, i will.
Dwight: i feared nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. huh. [in a fake english accent] you don't have a plan.
Other: when you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
Other: [holds up pen as dwight searches his desk] looking for this?
Dwight: what the? [follows nellie into the break room]
Other: oh, this is a lovely pen. ah. but, it's mine now because i stole it.
Dwight: [taking pen back] gimme that.
Other: didn't you sign a contract to live under taliban law? and now, there's been theft. that means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
Dwight: you're insane.
Other: i know. so, it's better that you pick another charity.
Dwight: oh, and let your precious operation power grab proceed unchecked? no thank you.
Other: in that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
Dwight: [considers then takes cleaver] this cleaver appears to need sharpening. i suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. tie a shoe, toss a salad. do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
Other: i tell you what. i need to make three calls. and then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
Dwight: sounds like a plan.
Andy: [in his office] clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
Erin: yeah.
Andy: [entering annex] clark, you and i need to have a little chat. what clothes does erin need for this news audition?
Other: uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Andy: really?
Other: yeah, industry secret. you're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
Other: seems unnecessary for an audition.
Other: and then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but i probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
Andy: thank god someone here knows what their talking about. i want you to take this credit card, take erin to the mall and get that stuff.
Other: i absolutely will do that.
Andy: awesome. [to pete] plop!
Other: pff. guess i'll just head over to the mall then. buy erin some sexy, fun outfits.
Other: that clark, huh? errr [punches palm] ca!
Oscar: [in kitchen with several people around] next question for our oldie-weds-
Kevin: what's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Angela: [to kevin] language.
Phyllis: who was pam's first celebrity crush?
Oscar: pam's first celebrity crush.
Toby: [whispering] john stamos.
Jim: ready?
Pam: uh-huh.
Jim: [as he and pam flip their cards] john stamos.
Angela: oh!
Pam: yes. but john stamos was temporary. i quickly moved on to-
Toby: johnny depp.
Pam: johnny depp. [everyone looks confused toward toby]
Toby: [after awkward pause] sh, uh, um, i was having this separate conversation with kevin. uh, johnny depp.
Kevin: totally. george clooney.
Toby: uh-huh.
Angela: ok, i have one. i have one. [jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere]
Kevin: [while angela tries asking a question] what is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Angela: [as pam wonders about jim] kevin, stop it with that question.
Jim: [in the stairwell on his phone] right. and did you show them the market? yeah. and what'd they say? that's awesome! that, oh my god! wow!
Jim: it's not even real yet. and i'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
Pam: i think maybe there actually is something i don't know about jim.
Darryl: everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss erin's confidence.
Andy: her body. we're gonna talk about her body. [to darryl] good. great job.
Darryl: andy made me his consigliere. which means assistant regional manager. i guess he thought i'd be into the godfather 'cause i'm black. wrong! i'm into the godfather 'cause i'm a cinephile. i like scarface 'cause i'm black.
Andy: [to a full conference room] erin has an audition to be a newscaster. [general acknowledgement]
Andy: uh-huh. and i want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. so, everybody say something that you like about her body. all right? darryl.
Darryl: ok, um, i like erin's hair. it's a very pretty color.
Andy: yeah, right?
Jim: i'm sorry. this is for a news audition?
Andy: yeah.
Oscar: then why are we talking about her looks? why not her credibility? or her reliability?
Andy: news flash everyone. the human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
Oscar: i'm so sorry, andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in america - walter cronkite.
Other: cronkite was hot. if i could go back in time, i'd take that mustache ride.
Oscar: does erin have any experience? has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? or...
Angela: has she done the pageant circuit?
Erin: no, i watch the news.
Andy: she's gonna be amazing. look at her. she's gonna light up the screen.
Erin: this is a first for me. and, i don't get a lot of chances, so i have to take them really seriously. i will do whatever it takes to get the job.
Other: [whispering to pete] whatever it takes.
Other: [whispering] yeah, i know, i heard. i heard.
Dwight: [places nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] this is it. any questions?
Other: is it gonna be long?
Dwight: no. it's gonna be over before you know it.
Erin: [pretending to read news] afghan president hamid karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. promising low, low prices on all 2012 kia sentras and sonatas. aren't you glad you waited? karzai commented.
Darryl: um, where did you get that story?
Erin: a little bit here, a little bit there. i bet you didn't think i knew current events.
Andy: i love it. it's fantastic. now, tag it with your name.
Erin: for channel 11 news, i'm erin hannon.
Andy: pause after 'news'.
Erin: for channel 11 news... i'm erin hannon.
Andy: no, pause longer.
Darryl: that was a good one.
Andy: pause, pause longer. ok? builds suspense. don't be shy.
Erin: got it. for channel 11 news... [very long pause]
Andy: wha, it's-
Erin: i'm erin hannon.
Andy: ok. all right. great. some great stuff in there.
Jim: [as pam stares at him] i can feel you looking at me.
Pam: ok. well, here's something you don't know. a couple of weeks ago-
Jim: uh-huh.
Pam: i ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. in the mall. and i didn't tell you because, i don't know, i felt embarrassed. and, i didn't know if you would be mad or worried. but, anyway, i thought you'd want to know.
Jim: [after a pause] that didn't happen. you would've told me right away.
Pam: yeah, i would've. what about you? come on, there's gotta be something. between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
Jim: uh... [looks at pam]
Pam: [looks knowingly back] just tell me.
Jim: god, give it up, beesley. you know me too well.
Dwight: heh! ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe nellie's hand] [darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
Other: hey, um, i knew something bothered me and i finally figured it out. what news producers are gonna want to see is how erin relates to the other people on the news team.
Erin: oh.
Other: the weird thing is erin is doing the audition alone.
Erin: oh god.
Other: now, i'd say clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
Erin: tuh.
Other: someone who's already got rapport with erin, maybe. i don't know. [andy smiles at camera]
Dwight: ha! [raises cleaver] this is for real this time.
Darryl: it's getting late. i thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration.
Other: [darryl hits play] oh, a movie. what is this?
Darryl: 127 hours. it's about this guy who-
Dwight: no, no. no spoilers. please.
Darryl: my bad.
Dwight: no.
Darryl: goodnight.
Other: [answers his door to find erin, andy and pete] hey! everybody.
Andy: yeah.
Other: come in.
Andy: all right!
Other: come on in.
Andy: nice.
Other: [to pete] what're you doing here?
Other: sorry, man. andy though erin needed a co-anchor. i'm his makeup guy. my hands are tied.
Erin: [news anchor audition] the victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
Andy: [also as anchor] wow. you know what they say erin. if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
Erin: well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
Andy: he sure did.
Other: all right. we got that. that's a rap, everybody.
Erin: aw!
Andy: just, you sure clark?
Other: yep, she's done.
Andy: no, i just, i don't mean erin. i mean for me. i didn't feel good about that.
Other: no, we got it. we got it.
Erin: great! let's get some food. i'm starving.
Andy: i don't think we did get it. i could do, uh, a couple more takes. we could do it in close-up. that might even be better for editing.
Other: ok, i don't.
Andy: all right.
Erin: i'm hungry.
Andy: uh, pete, you wanna take erin to get a burger or something?
Other: yeah, whatever you say, boss.
Andy: ok. [to erin] i'll call you later.
Erin: ok.
Andy: [to clark] so this is a single.
Erin: hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, i'm just glad i had the guts to do it. and, maybe it'll work out for andy.
Dwight: [as he and nellie watch the movie] oh god.
Other: that is absolutely revolting!
Dwight: yeah.
Other: he is so good, though.
Dwight: yes.
Other: the way he just cuts off his arm.
Dwight: if you like james franco, we really should watch rise of the planet of the apes.
Other: well, he's a genius, you know? he was in graduate programs at yale, columbia and nyu all at the same time.
Dwight: whoopty doo. that doesn't make you a genius.
Other: well, it doesn't make you stupid.
Dwight: yeah, it does, actually. it makes you real stupid.
Other: stupid like you.
Dwight: no, like you.
Other: like you.
Dwight: you're the stupid one.
Other: you're the stupid one.
Dwight: you're the stupid one.
Other: you're the stupid one.
Dwight: you, you, you, you...
Other: morning, dwight
Dwight: who are you?
Other: who am i? i'm jim. we've been working together for twelve years. ha, weird joke, dwight.
Dwight: you're not jim. jim's not asian
Other: you seriously never noticed? hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.
Dwight: alright then jim. ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
Other: uh, wellington systems? sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. or, were you talking about krieger-murphy? because i didn't close that one yet, but i'm hoping i've got a voicemail from paul krieger waiting for me.
Other: please enter your password.
Other: you have one new message.
Dwight: how did you know? no! no, no! that is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Other: dwight, cut it out, i'm trying to work.
Dwight: you don't work here! you're not jim!
Pam: jim, i got us that dinner reservation. grico???s at 7:30.
Other: oh great, can't wait. [kisses pam]
Pam: jim's at the dentist this morning. and steve is an actor friend of ours.
Dwight: i don't know who you are, but you are not jim. this is jim!
Dwight: oh my???! oh d???! oh, how did???? [gasps] huhhhhh!
Erin: heyyy! study buddies!
Darryl: oh, ok.
Erin: getting things done. awesome!
Darryl: it's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. life hacking, baby. this morning, i brushed my teeth in the shower. saved my self 90 seconds. which i just used to explain this to you. damn it!
Darryl: since andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, i've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. in fact, you know what? let???s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] whoa! that person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Erin: [speaking in french] s???il vous plait???dites-moi???ugggghhh les bleagh!
Dwight: ah, french. it's a great language. if you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
Erin: i'm just trying to fit in better with andy's family. they all speak more than one language. usually when i'm there!
Dwight: you wanna learn a really impressive second language? try dothraki. win over any man in my guild.
Dwight: dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of essos as featured in the superb home box office series, game of thrones. it has a lot of nudity. which i fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Dwight: i could teach you if you want. it's a lot easier than french.
Erin: yeah!  let???s do it!
Dwight: [exclaims] atherozar!
Erin: [shocked] oh!
Dwight: it means ???excellent???. and we have begun.
Pam: [asks nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. is everything okay?
Other: hmm? oh???oh, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. fine, fine, fine.  i'm mean, i d???i just don't wanna???burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
Pam: great.
Other: it???s just that i am taking my driver???s license test in two days, and i need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. but i've had no time to do that, thanks to ???demandy???...[points to andy's office with her thumb].  i just want to hit the open road and drive, man! but???in who's car?
Andy: [yells] nellie! get your wrinkly old balls in here.
Other: [sighs]
Pam: nellie, i could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
Other: oh, pam, thank you! you are my savior!  [hugs pam]
Other: [giggling] ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
Pam: [to jim] i'm sorry, i'm leaving you alone for lunch.
Jim: don't worry about it. i have a thing. a thing of soup. which i've been wanting to try.
Other: this is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. we can't. and here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Andy: executive-summary me. hit the highlights.
Other: well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of michaelle obama!
Andy: as in...
Other: wife of barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
Andy: [silently mouths] wow!
Andy: this is super-flattering. she's the most popular person in america. this is a big day for both of us.
Andy: my fellow americans, i have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. turns out, i am related to michaelle obama.
Erin: i was intimidated by andy's family before. and now i have to see the first lady at holidays? she's gonna be like, ???what's your stance on politics???? or, ???what is the best war to do???? and, i will just be like, ???duhhhh!???
Andy: alright! we gotta get rid of all this junk food. get fit, america! not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...i'm related to michaelle obama.
Other: yeah we noticed early on, andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
Other: so we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
Other: oooohhhhhhhh!
Other: it's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where i really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
Other: yeah, me too. it's weird. hard to remember what's real at this point.
Other: just clap through it, man.
Darryl: you log in sales at ten different times. if you log ???em all at once, you save a lot of time. it's called batching.
Jim: that was really good, darryl.
Darryl: life hacking, man.
Andy: there he is!
Jim: andy, you gotta check this out. he just showed me???[gets interrupted by andy].
Andy: [shushing jim] ahhhthathathathathta. right now i need canned tuna, okay? darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the first lady?
Darryl: tracee ellis ross. daughter of the first lady of motown, diana ross.
Andy: it's me! [chuckles] i am related to michaelle obama.
Darryl: what?! really?
Andy: i mean, it's distant, but...
Darryl: [chuckles in agreement] huh ha! that's cool, man.
Andy: right?
Andy: darryl said, ???cool, man.??? he called me as cool man.
Pam: you know, i really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
Other: mmmm???the thing is pam, i'm gonna be eating while i???m driving, so, i might as well get good at it.
Pam: brake lights. break lights! break lights! break lights!!!
Other: whhooooo!
Oscar: i???m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Phyllis: you think that andy's family owned slaves?
Other: well somebody owned somebody. and i don't think anybody would buy an andy.
Dwight: i throat-rip.
Erin: foth aggendak!
Dwight: you throat-rip.
Erin: foth aggendi!
Dwight: he/she/it throat rips.
Erin: foth aggenda!
Dwight: more of a, barbaric growl.
Erin: [in a barbaric growl] forth aggenda!
Dwight: louder! you???re shouting it from the back of a horse!
Erin: wah!! aggenda!!
Pam: pretty crazy about andy and michaelle obama, huh?
Other: [laughs mischievously] yeeeeahhhh! it's almost unbelievable!
Pam: what?
Other: well, you know how andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
Pam: sure.
Other: well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, i remembered that news story about michaelle obama having white relatives, and i just knew he would eat that up!
Pam: so he's not related to michaelle obama?
Other: pam, i barely know how to turn on my computer.
Pam: [laughs]
Pam: nellie's pretty fearless. and i think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
Other: [whispers] pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy???s head].
Pam: [laughs]
Oscar: well, if there???s another explanation, i don't really see what it could possibly be. i???[gets cut by andy barging into the convo]
Andy: what's going on here? i'm related to the first lady, okay? get over it. [chuckles] i still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? get back to work! [mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl].
Oscar: andy! andy! no! i would be very polite today.
Andy: why? is it employee???s day or something? i cannot keep track of these bs holidays.
Oscar: your connection. to michaelle obama has certain... negative connotations. most likely, your family were???slave owners.
Andy: does anyone else think it's possible that i come from slave owners?
Darryl: whoa! that person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
Andy: hey mom, it's andy. give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about america's national shame, thanks, bye.
Darryl: yes, yes, yes.
Andy: great. ooo! spreadsheets! yum, yum!
Darryl: i included some time saving ideas...
Andy: huh huh huh. look, i'm not gonna lie to ya, i'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
Darryl: look, andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. this is only weird if you make it weird.
Andy: [snaps his fingers] right on, brotha. wurddd.
Erin: addor!
Dwight: daraas!
Erin: qazer!
Dwight: daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] does anyone here have fermented mare???s milk?
Other: hey erin!
Erin: azem choma! chomakka-attun!
Other: oh???okay. sorry.
Other: oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Pam: yeah???turn signal. it's exciting to be painting again???those are the wipers. so???the???its???just. there you go! yeah. [chuckles]  yeah, things get so busy with the kids???red light???that it's nice to have that creative outlet???red light! red light! red! red!
Other: that is brilliant, pam. i would love to see some of your work.
Pam: well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural i did for angela's baby.
Other: that???s amazing, pam! oh, i love the lion in the tuxedo!
Pam: angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
Andy: [to erin]. heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
Erin: vos!
Andy: so, no? you think maybe you could remind people? i'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
Erin: because of your slaves.
Andy: not my slaves, my ancestors???. maybe. probably not.
Erin: well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for ???slave master???, ???attafrauk!???, is a term of respect. i'm learning how to speak dothraki! color you impressed?
Andy: that you???re learning a made-up language from hbo???s game of thrones?  i have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
Erin: dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
Dwight: people laughed at klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
Andy: hi guys.
Phyllis: hey boss! i am so thirsty. could i have a scoop of water?
Andy: yeah. you don't have to ask me.
Andy: ha ha! okay. great. very funny. i get it. just because my ancestors happen to be???[ringtone of dixie plays].  very funny, kevin. changed my ringtone. very funny. i liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was ???diamonds on the soles of her shoes??? by paul simon, featurinnnngg lady smith???african american???mambazo.
Pam: good. very good. [cell phone beeping]oh???no! here. it's, uh, a text from andy. ???new special proj. need fam tree for evbody. really dig up dirt a.s.a.p.??? and then in parentheses, he wrote out ???as soon as possible.???
Other: mm. ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. write back, ???looking for dirt.???
Pam: oh, can i help? we could say someone is related to, uhm, tonya harding.
Other: pam, i'm related to tonya harding.
Pam: oh???gee???i???m???
Other: no! i'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] i love it.
Pam: brilliant!
Other: what should we say about jim?
Pam: ummm. oh! i'll say he's related to richard nixon. it's an inside joke. he looks really nixon-y when he wakes up.
Other: my ex behaved like nixon. all of the lying. none of the sexual charisma. [pauses] i just made a joke there.
Pam: i'm sorry. it's just, uhm, i actually do have this weird feeling that there???s something jim isn't telling me.
Other: oh no! oh! an affair! it is always an affair!
Pam: jim? no.
Other: [sighs]. how can you be sure?
Pam: because he just loves me too much.
Other: you're a cocky little thing, aren't you, pam?
Andy: i've done a little genealogy research of my own. turn out i'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol??? family closet. for example, phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the united states.
Angela: ew.
Andy: kevin is related to both john wayne gacy and john wayne bobbitt.
Kevin: and john wayne?
Andy: no. not that i see here.
Kevin: wayne johnson? the rock?
Andy: you mean dwayne? and no. what about jim halpert? uh oh! turns out, distant relative of the reviled, richard nixon!
Jim: pam always says i look like nixon. that's crazy, right? i mean there's nothing there. true???[touches his nose] oh no.
Andy: dwight's grandfather was a???[is interrupted by dwight].
Dwight: was a member of the bund. which is not technically the same thing as the nazi party. so???[clears throat]
Andy: i was gonna say he was a tax evader.
Dwight: oh. i was joking about that whole bund thing. oh ho, the look on your faces! hahhahahahahah! hahahahahah!
Andy: and meredith is a blood relative of lizzie borden.
Other: cool! ah! ah! ah! ah! [mimics stabbing into angela???s throat]
Angela: stop it! stop it! you're frightening me!
Phyllis: andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
Kevin: yeah, that???you're being really mean, andy.
Dwight: yeah, andy.
Andy: no, i'm proving a point, okay? we all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. but it's in the past and it???s not our fault. so we don't have to talk about it.
Oscar: the difference is, andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
Andy: might've done. and how??? do you figure?
Oscar: your family's rich! i have to believe that a big part of the bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Andy: you know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in america, oscar! i'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. that wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
Oscar: really?
Andy: we merely transported them. which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
Andy: yo, d-dog. i need your help. i'm trying to think of things i can say that make it sound like i had a more difficult childhood than i actually had.
Darryl: you???re gonna po??? mouth
Andy: exactly. help me po??? mouth, darryl.
Darryl: actually, andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions???
Andy: what if i said that my dad beat me. and, i just left out the croquet of it all. or, i could just go all the way and just say i grew up in an apartment. or is that too crazy?
Darryl: that could work.
Andy: you now, darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and i feel like i'm doing all the heavy lifting. i'm coming up with all the ideas here.
Darryl: i???m going for a walk.
Andy: [with a sigh] okay.
Pam: good. good. and???[nellie hits the car against the bushes]
Jim: you doing alright, man?
Darryl: i'm done. i gotta get out of here.
Jim: yeah. not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Darryl: it's not just today, it's everyday. it seems like the better title i have, the stupider my job gets.
Jim: oh, come on, it can always get better. right?
Darryl: hmm. yeah right
Jim: no, i'm serious. there's always something better.
Darryl: like what?
Jim: like hypothetically??? if i said there was another job. that you and i could both have.
Darryl: what kind of job?
Jim: something cool. like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Darryl: hell yeah!
Jim: right?
Darryl: that sounds awesome!
Jim: ok, but wait. what if i told you that it was in philly! so you'd have to...
Darryl: i love philly!
Jim: right?
Darryl: it's not even a thought???
Jim: not even a thought!  it's not even that far away! i could still commute! exactly. exactly! alright!
Darryl: what? wait, wait, wait? so what? this happening?
Jim: oh, it???s happening!  let???s just keep it between you and me for right now.
Darryl: yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah. for sure. for sure. for sure. man!  and pam's into it?
Jim: we, uh, we haven't talked about. but i think that she's???i think she understands... what this is.
Darryl: oh, come on, man. i thought you had something real.
Jim: what? no, no, no! come on! this is real!
Darryl: it's not real... until your wife is on board.
Pam: so what did you want to show me?
Other: that is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
Pam: yeah. it's really ugly
Other: needs something, doesn't it? i'm thinking???a mural.
Pam: you mean me?

Pam: oh my god! i love it! uh, i???nellie, this is brilliant!  [sees jim] hey!
Jim: hey! can i talk you? for a second?
Other: anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. she never loved you!
Pam: what?! no! i-i got this. [laughs] okay?
Other: [quietly] this is his fault. it is not your fault. i'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
Other: and filipino. but we???ll break that to her later.

Darryl: yeah. you too, huh?

Darryl: hey! he deserves this. and he said i could get in on it too.  [whispers] yeah.
Other: ohhh, pam, nooo! oh, i can't bear to watch this.
Jim: i don't know what i was so worried about. i have the best wife in the world.

Darryl: that was a triple.
Andy: can't take the fail? get out of the fail video!
Darryl: my pleasure.
Other: andy:
Oscar: what was that? that was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
Andy: well, i worked with what i had, oscar. next time do more failure stuff, ok?
Jim: uh, what happened to that video i sent you?
Andy: oh that wasn't...that didn't work. that was not the right..[group protests]
Jim: i think i got it right here.
Andy: that was not a fail.
Other: fail! fail! fail!...
Andy: [group continues chanting ???fail!???]that was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [group keeps chanting] you're all failing right now. [group continues] congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [group claps and chants]
Dwight: [toby uses tester on wall as erin marks wall with red tape x] oh, god.

Dwight: ok, excuse me. i am the landlord. this is between me and the management, no one else. please.
Toby: it's an emf hotspot.
Phyllis: [gasps] oh my god!
Oscar: it stands for electromagnetic field.  generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [erin marks red tape x on the floor] especially if they're poorly insulated. dwight.
Andy: um, ok i'm just walking into this. am i to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
Toby: you think i have a machine for measuring bee hives?
Andy: i was just asking a question, toby. how are you not murdered every hour?
Other: well i'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
Dwight: ok, listen. everything here is up to code.
Dwight: [mocking] oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] it's a wire people. i'm not buying it a fur coat.
Pam: [jim rushes to open door for her] thank you.
Jim: you got it.
Jim: last week, i finally told pam about the other job i took in philly...the side job. and she was so incredibly cool about it. and now i just wanna do something huge for her. like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and i was like wham! [mimes punch] gotta go through me first.
Other: andy, could i have a word please? um, it won't take a moment. it's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
Andy: fine. i will give you one minute.
Other: oh, please don't use the hourglass.
Andy: you have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
Other: i'm trying to adopt a baby.
Andy: a baby what? a human?!
Other: and the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
Andy: oh.

Andy: time's up!
Other: fine.
Andy: sure.  i'll read her letter. and if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. i'll sign that.
Dwight: [reading from computer] ???statistical correlations exist between emf radiation and various health hazards. but mainstream studies are inconclusive!??? that means you can't make me do squat.
Other: you better fix this. i already ditched my uterus and i ain't losing any more good parts.
Dwight: you people don't realize what you're asking. i'd have to rip open the walls.  we'd have to shut this place down for a week.
Pam: week off. that'd be great.
Darryl: [jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] hey, if you don't want to teach me power point, just say so.

Darryl: you could be.
Other: mm-mm.

Dwight: what? come on.
Other: i'm getting older. i'm losing my hair...
Other: i'm not gonna grow a third arm!
Dwight: i know what jim is trying to do. he's trying to get big bad dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky jimbo gets a paid vacation. well sorry, lucky jimbo, i can live very happily in a magnetic field. most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
Jim: [reading from computer] ???side effects of emf include: headaches...???
Dwight: had 'em all my life.
Jim: ???..breast pain...???
Dwight: no nobbies, no probbies. nice try jim.
Jim: oof. ???infertility.???

Dwight: psh. keep your snacks on your side, jim. idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] what the?
Jim: what?
Dwight: some of these kernels have crowned.

Pam: oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
Jim: you mean laverne's pies tires fixed also? [pam nods] yes we will be doing that. we'll be getting a dozen.
Pam: a dozen different pies? cause that means rhubarb.
Jim: why would you say that? i meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. i thought that was implied.
Pam: yeah, ok then.
Andy: ladies and gentlemen, i have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
Dwight: so, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Other: nice job.
Dwight: in my contract, it is stipulated that i provide a temporary work space. it will arrive in one hour.
Jim: what?
Pam: what's this?
Andy: whoa!
Jim: what?
Dwight: [bus pulls into lot] bring it in!
Dwight: roll into the future with work bus. say goodbye to wasteful buildings. these days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. now anyone can rent a work bus. [meredith and kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] if you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [erin tapes candy dish to pole] in this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Other: [on phone] there are a hundred packs..
Oscar: [on phone] no six after the eight, no....
Other: shh!
Oscar: shh!

Other: lose weight.
Erin: i'm trying. sorry.
Erin: [handing nelly envelope] oh, the pennsylvania department of public welfare pre-adoption standard.
Other: oh of course, you were adopted.
Erin: [laughs] i wish! no, i um, i made some short lists. i had a couple sleepovers, but i never managed to get in the end zone. i don't know what it was. not loveable maybe? [laughs] oh well.
Other: listen, i'm really struggling with this form. but as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Erin: absolutely.  i know exactly what they want to hear. i would love to help.
Other: oh thank you so much!
Erin: [whispers] just don't tell andy, because..
Other: he hates me and thinks i'm a monster. should go back to loch ness. [erin nods]
Other: stretch. alright.
Other: how many times do you need to take a stroll?
Other: i, my legs cramp up! ok, it's a circulation issue.
Other: boy, i will hammer spank your rear.
Jim: alright, alright, gang. let's just settle down. you're yelling in her face.
Other: it's a medical thing.
Jim: just...you good?
Other: i'm good. i..
Jim: [to pam] i'm so sorry for all of this.
Pam: it's ok. you know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.

Pam: oh my god! ah!

Pam: you know what? it's fine, it's fine. let me just...it's fine. [pam leaves work bus]
Jim: pam, i'm really sorry. i- i'm really sorry about...all that. [dwight smiles at jim] really? smirking?
Dwight: what can i say? i love justice. you forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Jim: hey, dwight. i was trying to do something nice for pam.  can you just, help me out? can we maybe take this thing somewhere? or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Dwight: it's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Jim: andy!
Andy: yo. dudeces.
Jim: you're the boss. don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in pennsylvania?
Phyllis: oh, i know i'd be more productive.
Kevin: as would i.
Other: no question.
Dwight: no. no! this is a work bus. the wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Jim: what are you talking about? you're not the boss. andy is. andy?
Other: pies! pies! pies! pies! pies!
Andy: alright! the fat people have spoken! dwight, get this bus moving.
Erin: yes! [group cheers]
Jim: next stop: laverne's pies tires fixed also.
Pam: oh! yes! [group cheers, dwight moves to driver seat]
Jim: [to dwight] so it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
Dwight: get your foot behind the yellow line.
Jim: you got it.
Erin: yeah jim! [group claps]
Darryl: [sitting outside building] stop.
Other: come back.

Andy: dunder mifflin road trip twenty twelve! [group takes pictures] ah ok, now a serious one.
Pam: hey, where's dwight? he should be a part of this. has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
Jim: if by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
Pam: no, i mean he's sulking. that's not like him.
Jim: he's just mad that we're all having fun.
Pam: then why isn't he scheming? or preparing to avenge?
Jim: he's fine. he's indestructible.
Erin: always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. we're not hostages.
Other: [laughs] well, i have considered kidnapping one.
Erin: never say that.
Erin: i am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
Other: i wish i could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. i would snap you up.
Other: next stop pies! [group joins in]
Other: next stop pies!
Kevin: next stop pies!
Jim: let's go driver! [clapping] laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
Kevin: at five? that's only twenty minutes from now. the pie shop is thirteen miles away. so at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Angela: so wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
Kevin: wh...
Oscar: hold on, kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
Kevin: 314 pies.
Oscar: what if it were salads?
Kevin: well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
Dwight: i'm sorry to spoil jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
Jim: ok, well i saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Dwight: that name brand place? nope forget about it, sorry. the tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Jim: are you kidding me? dwight, come on!
Pam: hey honey, i don't think we should push him.
Jim: oh no, i'm gonna push him. you know why? because you're getting a pie. why? cause you deserve it. and what is he doing? he's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. is that what we want?!
Other: no!
Dwight: stop ordering me around, jim!
Jim: what do we want?!
Other: pies!
Jim: when do we want it?!
Other: pies!
Dwight: ok, fine. you win.  jim, you win. we have been battling for a long time, but you know what? you win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in jim's lap] alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. go buy the whole world a pie.
Jim: that's impossible. [dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] dwight!
Other: oh my!
Jim: what are you doing?
Other: dwight, what the hell?
Oscar: dwight!
Other: what?
Kevin: well now i don't even feel like pie. wait...no it's back.
Phyllis: [dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] just drive away. just..
Pam: phyllis! that's not safe.
Kevin: guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  at sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
Pam: [to jim] go up and check on him. he's upset.
Jim: you know he's doing all this on purpose.
Pam: please? just make sure he's ok? [jim climbs through hatch]
Other: hurry it up for god's sake. they're gonna be out of banana cream!
Andy: banana cream is the first to go.  we'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
Other: what?
Jim: dwight? why are you such a jerk? i am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
Dwight: i'm barren, jim.
Jim: what?
Dwight: my trouser hives are void of honey.  i had congress with angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. i thought i would be a father and instead i am a eunuch. neutered by my own building.
Jim: is this about the popcorn? or the x on the ceiling? dwight, that was a prank.
Dwight: you mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Jim: no.
Dwight: that's genius. that's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
Jim: i'll take it.
Other: andy?
Andy: who is it?
Other: um, is this a good time?
Andy: yeah. perfect time. i'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from nelly] fine, let me read it. what do we have here? uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. it's unsignable.
Other: oh, why, is there something?
Andy: it's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? dongwater.
Other: ah well, perhaps i could rewrite some of the-
Andy: here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? i did it. i read it. thank you very much to me for my time.  good luck with your impossible dream.
Other: alright then.
Jim: dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
Dwight: really? how long did it take you and pam to conceive?
Jim: that doesn't matter.
Dwight: what position did you use to conceive?
Jim: ok...that's not...
Dwight: regular? or lady on her back? you used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. yuck, gross. never mind, jim.
Andy: [to pete. crying sounds come from behind nelly's curtain] british women. famously overemotional. am i right?
Other: i don't think that's nelly.
Andy: what?
Other: oh, oh no, no. look, it's alright. [erin cries, nelly comforts her] it really isn't your fault. no, no. look, it's...you were so kind. and it isn't anything to do with you.
Jim: did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
Dwight: you know there's a phrase about that in german. bildenkinder. used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. but now? i really understand it.
Jim: well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
Dwight: bildenkinder.
Jim: ok. and they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. and there's only one guy who can save them. it's not me.
Pam: oh! [jim reenters bus through hatch] hey! how'd it go?
Jim: it's pretty good actually.
Pam: yeah?
Jim: we bonded. we got to- [dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of jim]
Oscar: whoa! whoa! dwight! [group reacts]
Dwight: when you don't get out of the way! out of the way!
Pam: you feel ok now?
Dwight: oh, better than ok. [grabs pam's shoulders] you know what honey? i'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
Pam: well, actually, rhubarb is-
Jim: don't..
Pam: the one pie that i don't.
Jim: don't..
Dwight: everybody! hang on! [dwight pulls out quickly]
Angela: oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other]
Jim: [group chants along] pie! pie! pie!
Other: pie! pie! pie! pie! [cheers as they arrive]
Other: oh.
Andy: i changed my mind. [gives nelly papers]
Other: oh, you signed it?
Andy: yeah. not as is, obviously. made a couple changes. added some sentences at the end. trust me it needed it. [laughs] well, yeah, whatever. so. [walks away]
Other: [reading] ???she's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. she'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.???
Kevin: i insult you, oscar.
Oscar: what?
Kevin: i insult you! to your face!
Oscar: i don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin: then why don't you do something about it?
Oscar: [laughs] kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? in the face with my pie?
Kevin: you don't have the guts. you stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [oscar pies kevin] yes!
Pam: oh my god. i'm getting so stuffed.
Jim: we did it.
Pam: you did it.
Andy: my name is andy!
Other: [bored] yeah.

Other: yeah. [andy plays banjo]
Pam: role call.
Phyllis: role call.
Oscar: role call.
Other: what?
Dwight: this year i decided to really get into the spirit of halloween.
Erin: [screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed dwight]
Dwight: [screaming then laughing] it may have been the costliest decision i???ve ever made.
Dwight: my greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
Jim: it won???t budge.
Dwight: i can???t get it out. try again!
Dwight: i mean, i could try destroying the pumpkin...
Dwight: [as jim approaches with a knife] jim, no. no. no! no!
Dwight: but as jim and i discovered...  no! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
Dwight: at first i drove myself crazy thinking about the things i should have done differently. i never should have played that joke on erin. i never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. then i realized that i was being silly. i mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. right?
Erin: hey guys.
Pam: hey.
Erin: pam, what are you?
Pam: i am dr. cinderella.
Jim: cece???s really into princesses now. so we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Pam: i???m an oncologist and you are a dog.
Erin: no, i???m a puppy. dang it! i was worried that would happen.
Jim: it???s okay.
Erin: uh, jim, you???re not dressed up at all.
Jim: sure i am. i am... one of the men in black guys. [to pam, under his breath] can i have your sunglasses?
Erin: jim, come on. i thought we were past this.
Pam: so the sports marketing business that jim told everyone about except for me?
Jim: there???s a big investment lunch today, so i decided to skip the costume.
Pam: unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Jim: gettin??? a lot of mileage out of this, aren???t ya?
Pam: yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
Andy: a jitterbug. [giggles] you guys look great! just a reminder. the party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. any questions?
Angela: the senator will be joining us later.
Andy: not a question.
Angela: no, it wasn???t.
Andy: excellent. that reminds me, has anyone seen treble? anyone? i could have sworn i saw some treble somewhere.
Other: [singing]
Andy: oh, ladies and gentlemen, here comes treble!
Other: [sings karma chameleon]
Andy: aaah! [everyone clapping] so good!
Dwight: what lab did these little clones escape from?
Andy: my cornell a capella group.
Pam: you were in an a capella group?
Darryl: you went to cornell?
Andy: yah! ah. okay. ha ha ha ha. but you have no idea how lucky you are because hct is doing a set at our halloween party.
Other: ugh. i don???t want to sit through a whole concert of that.
